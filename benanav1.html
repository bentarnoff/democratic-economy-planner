    Groundwork for a Multi-Criterial Economy

Few would disagree that beneath today’s political turbulence there lies
a profound economic malaise. Growth rates in the advanced economies are
stagnating; when pumped by stimulus, the gains go disproportionately to
upper-income brackets. Oligopolistic firms have repositioned themselves
at the pinnacles of global value chains, retaining property rights while
outsourcing the processes of production to ever-cheaper bidders, forced
to compete among themselves. Large portions of corporations’ retained
earnings are no longer invested domestically but channelled into
financial assets, ‘de-risked’ by public bailout. Meanwhile, investment
decisions that will shape the future of life on earth—geo-engineering,
artificial intelligence, carbon capture, nuclear power—are taken by tiny
private coteries, incentivized to back the riskiest long
shots.footnote^1 <#note-1>

Underlying this vertical trend towards the oligopolistic consolidation
of economic power, there has been a secular horizontal shift in economic
activity, from manufacturing into services—health, education, retail,
administration—where productivity growth rates are lower and
profitability can only be maintained through intensified exploitation or
higher prices. Deindustrialization has been unfolding for a half-century
in advanced economies. Symptoms of ‘premature deindustrialization’, long
entrenched in Brazil and South Korea, are now appearing in China. And
everywhere, falling birth rates mean fewer young workers and consumers,
shrinking future markets and weakening incentives for private investment
in expanding productive capacities just as care burdens rise. Unmet
social needs proliferate; material wants like poverty, hunger, disease
and inadequate housing compound growing levels of ecological
degradation, social alienation and psychological stress. If there is
ever to be a left break beyond the current political impasse—the
liberal-capitalist establishment locked in a wrestler’s embrace with the
ultra-capitalist right—it will ultimately require the elaboration of an
economic system beyond capitalism itself.footnote^2 <#note-2>

Historically, the defence of capitalism has rested on its results. Its
ruthless focus on profitability has never been only about exploiting
workers or extracting resources to enrich coupon-clipping investors.
Especially in earlier periods, the drive for profit also served socially
useful ends—chief among them the pursuit of economic efficiency, both in
static terms (minimizing costs and maximizing revenues) and in dynamic
ones (developing more efficient production methods and entirely new
products). Capitalism’s profit drive helped generate extraordinary leaps
in material living standards—reflected not only in rising monetary
incomes, but also in a proliferation of transformative process and
product innovations. The former includes the assembly line, container
shipping and computer-numerical control; the latter, indoor plumbing,
electricity, railroads, cars, planes, washing machines, computers,
pharmaceuticals, ready meals and fast fashion. In the richest countries,
average real incomes have expanded by a factor of twenty since the 1820s
and across the world as a whole by a factor of more than ten.

Capitalism is thus more than a system of market exchange rooted in
exploitation and extraction. It is a distinctive type of market economy—
based on concentrated private property and wage-dependent labour—in
which firms must compete for market share, and hence for profit. Profit
is not just a reward for efficiency-focused activity, but also a source
of investment funds which highly efficient firms use to expand their
operations.footnote^3 <#note-3> The search for monetary returns on
investment engendered an economic dynamism without historical parallel.
Earlier modes of production, even those with significant markets,
developed at a far slower pace, with cycles of demographic expansion and
contraction spanning centuries, while agricultural practices remained
stagnant for generations. Capitalism’s profit imperative, by contrast,
compelled firms to pursue continual innovation—both in processes that
reduce costs and liberate resources, and in products that redirect those
resources towards new forms of revenue generation. Together, these
dynamics produced a sustained trajectory of economic growth.

But capitalism’s very successes have generated problems that the pursuit
of profit is not equipped to solve. The vast build-out of manufacturing
and urban growth, compounded by rising fossil-fuel consumption, threaten
the planet’s environmental and climatic systems. The entry of billions
of new rural workers into the capitalist labour force puts downward
pressure on wages, while the glut of productive capacity speeds
capital’s flight into financial assets. Soaring longevity, thanks to
medical advance, and falling birth rates, as horizons opened for women
beyond hearth and home, combine in a demographic drag-weight of
care.footnote^4 <#note-4> With the global engines of growth now
faltering, the defence of capitalism by its results is increasingly hard
to mount.

When an economy built around economic efficiency runs out of efficiency
gains, it stagnates. Inequality rises; speculative excess intensifies.
Socially destructive profit-seeking strategies—externalizing costs onto
the environment, suppressing wages, entrenching monopoly power—are
always present, but they grow more aggressive, as capital turns towards
exploitation, extraction and enclosure. As growth recedes, the human
needs and aspirations bracketed by capitalism’s exclusive pursuit of
profit-driven efficiencies are left exposed. Its defenders had always
argued that capitalist growth would supply the best means to deal with
broader social challenges, whether political, cultural or
environmental.footnote^5 <#note-5> Yet attempts to incorporate other
principles into capitalist operations—ethical consumption, esg
investing, corporate social-responsibility programmes—remain constrained
by the system’s profit-driven logic. Qualitative goals are reduced to
quantitative targets, producing performative compliance with little
tangible effect. Similarly, broader state-backed reforms aim to
ameliorate the system by introducing secondary goals—social-democratic
measures, environmental regulation—while leaving the logic of ‘single-
criterion optimization’—that is, production for profit—unchanged. These
programmes can play a welcome role in mitigating exploitation and
ecological harm, but they remain at the mercy of capitalism’s
profitability requirements and will be scythed by public-spending cuts
should state revenues fall short.

But then, the deeper problem is not just that capitalism is failing to
live up to its promise of rising living standards—the issue is that
living standards are understood in an extremely narrow way: in terms of
incomes, as measured by gdp per capita. Organizing a society around a
single metric will always be an impoverished way of structuring
collective life. The same logic would apply to any economy organized
around a single guiding principle. Even a post-capitalist social order
that abandoned profit maximization while maintaining output maximization
as its organizing goal would still operate through single-criterion
optimization. No matter which metric is chosen, the result is always a
radical simplification of the multi-dimensional problems we face.

The goal, therefore, should be to create an economic system in which
coordination could be structured according to multiple criteria. The
immense technical and productive capacities of modern economies would be
directed towards meeting broader human ends, evolving over time.
Socialism has sometimes been framed as the pursuit of free time, of
environmental balance, of foregrounded social care; but it could pursue
all those goals—and more.footnote^6 <#note-6> Trade-offs across our
goals will be inevitable; no society can maximize all priorities at
once. But these trade-offs could be collectively negotiated through
political debate, rather than dictated by an impersonal logic. The task
is to build an economic order capable of evolving to accommodate new
values and changing conditions, steadily adjusting the organization of
production to encompass them. A multi-criterial economy would thus
demand a fundamental shift in how production is organized and how
economic decisions are made.footnote^7 <#note-7>

This framework would go beyond the notion of transforming the economy to
serve the majority—an economic democracy /for/ the people—or including
workers in its administration—a limited form of economic democracy /by /
the people.footnote^8 <#note-8> It also challenges traditions on the
left that imagine a world beyond capitalism as a world beyond politics.
Under socialism, August Bebel imagined, personal interests and social
interests would coincide so fully that ‘the satisfaction of personal
egotism and service of society will be harmonious’.footnote^9 <#note-9>
The democratization of production would involve technical debate—
productive capacities, social needs, labour-time embodied in each
product—but not substantive political disagreement. Yet the socialist
canon also contains more open-ended conceptions of collective agency.
Echoing Marx, Engels famously wrote that only under socialism would ‘man
himself, with full consciousness, make his own history’. Kautsky, too,
insisted that a socialist regime would ‘from the beginning seek to
organize production democratically’.footnote^10 <#note-10>

The aim here is to extend this broader conception of economic
democratization—while criticizing the limited ways that this
democratization was understood in the past. What follows will trace the
fortunes of an intrinsically multivalent idea of socialism as it
encountered the growing complexity of modern capitalist society, from
the early utopians to the Bolshevik Revolution and beyond. It will
examine the signal attempts by heterodox thinkers to conceive forms of
coordination beyond the profit motive and the central plan, building on
their insights and breakthroughs to lay the groundwork for a genuinely
multi-criterial economic order. In Part Two of this study, to be
published in the next number of /New Left Review/, I will outline the
institutional architecture needed for such an order and set out the
steps of a transitional programme that could connect today’s immediate
struggles to a broader social transformation.


      1. a broader tradition

Conceptions of a multi-criterial economy date back to the first
stirrings of capitalism itself. In Thomas More’s /Utopia/ (1516), the
narrator laments the plight of the English tenant farmers, dispossessed
by the enclosures of the highly profitable wool trade. ‘Wherever you
have private property, and money is the measure of all things, it is
hardly ever possible for a commonwealth to be just or prosperous’, his
interlocutor replies.footnote^11 <#note-11> /Utopia/ portrayed a country
where goods were held in common, freely dispensed from public
storehouses. For More, the eradication of money would make possible the
realization of multiple social goals, not only security for all but also
greater durability of products and an increase in access to free time.
In seventeenth-century England, Winstanley cast a similar project in
more biblical terms, calling for the earth to become ‘a common
treasury’. In eighteenth-century France, Rousseau also saw a connection
between wealth and injustice: the law served merely as a justification
for the rich; the role of money should be sharply reduced, if not
abolished, with a return to household production and fulfilment sought
through active citizenship and collective life. In 1796, as the momentum
of the French Revolution went into reverse, ‘Gracchus’ Babeuf and his
Conspiracy of Equals drew inspiration from More’s /Utopia/.footnote^12
<#note-12>

By the 1820s, a new generation of utopians—Owen, Fourier, Saint-Simon—
was theorizing the role that industrial machinery might play in a
community-regulated economy. In 1839, their radical-republican
contemporary Étienne Cabet was the first to call for a communist
movement. Cabet read /Utopia/ at Owen’s urging while in exile in England
and drew upon it for his /Travels in Icaria /(1839), whose title page
proclaimed the slogan, ‘To each according to his needs, from each
according to his abilities’—famously borrowed by Marx to describe the
‘higher phase of communist society’ in the /Critique of the Gotha
Programme/ (1875).footnote^13 <#note-13> Like More, Cabet saw the aims
of a moneyless economy as plural. He printed those aims in the shape of
a diamond directly above his famous slogan: such an economy would foster
love, justice, mutual aid, universal insurance, the organization of
labour, the use of machines for the benefit of all, the arts and more.

It was this early, multi-criterial version of communism that Marx
encountered as a 25-year-old in 1840s Paris and transmitted, in a
modernized and vastly more sophisticated form, to the mass workers’
movements that arose from the 1870s amid the Second Industrial
Revolution. As he noted in his polemic with Proudhon, the plight of the
handloom weavers, confronted with the vastly higher output of mechanized
power looms, showed that simply introducing a ‘truer’ form of money
based on labour time would not abolish inequality; the entire mode of
production had to be transformed, with community regulation replacing
the quest for private profit. Above all, the communal organization of
the economy would allow other values to come into play.

Marx famously proclaimed (in the 1873 afterword to the second German
edition of /Capital/, /Volume One/) that he wouldn’t write recipes for
the cook-shops of the future. They would be written by the cooks
themselves. Nevertheless, his criticism of actually existing capitalism—
its degradation of the soil, contamination of the product (bread bulked
out by sawdust) and exhaustion of the worker—outlined what the contrast
might entail. The associated producers of the future would abolish the
reign of the monetary economy in order to structure their work around
multiple criteria: including above all the restoration of the ecological
conditions of life, universal economic security, the end of exploitation
and the expansion of a realm of freedom for all to enjoy. For both Marx
and Engels, the first steps towards a post-capitalist future seem to
have involved the institution of a radical democracy to end the
political rule of the capitalist class—hailed by Marx in the form of the
recallable delegates of the Paris Commune—then a ‘groping forward’
through nationalizations, a wealth tax and other transitional measures,
while combating capitalist resistance.footnote^14 <#note-14>

By the late nineteenth century, the sheer expansion of economic
production made it seem less necessary to articulate specific social
goals. The socialization of production appeared likely to bring about
such a rapid increase in output that further specification seemed beside
the point—except to emphasize the radical expansion of both consumption
and free time it would enable. This vision of the future, popularized in
works like Bebel’s /Woman and Socialism/ (1879), Bukharin and
Preobrazhensky’s /abc / /of Communism/ (1919) and James Kennedy’s /The
Lumber Industry and Its Workers/ (1922), was taken up by the mass
socialist parties, which essentially shared the More-to-Marx ideal of a
community-run economy, freed of money and private property, albeit now
with the working class in the role of universal liberator. At the same
time—Kautsky’s rejection of blueprints was typical in this—they still
refused to plan for planning; how to go about the socialization of the
economy would be obvious to those undertaking it. The reality, of
course, was not a steady advance towards socialism but a precipitous
descent into the industrial slaughterhouse of the First World War,
backed by major sections of the international workers’ movement.

The revolutionary wave of 1917–21 that arose from that maelstrom—with
mass uprisings across the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian lands as
the imperial orders fell, and Soviet republics declared in Bavaria,
Breman, Würzburg and Hungary—came closest to realizing the conditions
for that vision. Nevertheless, the chance was missed. The workers’
movements met far fiercer ruling-class resistance, military, political
and ideological, than most of their leaders had anticipated; and by the
1920s they confronted far more complex capitalist economic and social
structures than had existed in the 1870s, buttressed by the mass media
and advertising, and supported by intermediate class layers. Meanwhile,
deeper structural changes were undermining the assumptions on which the
original model of community regulation had been built.

That model presumed convergence—of technical forms of labour and of
social values. But the actual trajectory was one of divergence.
Industrial development did not homogenize the working class into a mass
of interchangeable labourers. Instead, it generated increasingly complex
and layered forms of production, dependent on specialized and often
mutually unintelligible knowledges—fragmenting the material basis for
democratic economic coordination. At the same time, new social struggles
—feminist, anti-racist, anti-colonial, nationalist and environmentalist—
not only identified additional forms of domination, but advanced
competing claims about how to define what mattered—autonomy,
recognition, security, dignity, care, sustainability—and how to
prioritize across these values. Socialists’ failures to grasp these
tectonic shifts—and the idea that they would know what to do when the
time came—proved a strategic disaster.


      2. hard lessons

By 1921, with the Red Army’s civil-war victory, it was becoming clear
that the Bolsheviks alone had succeeded; the revolutionary forces
elsewhere were being crushed. But the Russian economy was in complete
disarray. Workers had abandoned the factories; peasants, freed at last
from their landlords’ predation, no longer supplied the cities with
sufficient food. In these conditions, with the centralization of the
party-state apparatus hardening under Stalin, the infant Soviet Union
began constructing the first centrally planned industrial society.
Needless to say, the state-socialist ‘command economy’ was based on the
repression of differing viewpoints, not the community-led democracy
envisaged from More to Marx. But the Soviet order was still in a
fundamental sense an effort to introduce a community-regulated form of
production, replacing market allocation with centrally set Five-Year
Plans. However, though not driven by profit, it remained narrowly
focused, for the most part, on maximizing output.

Though the Soviet command economy went deeply awry, it made certain
important discoveries. Above all, it pioneered the use of coordinated
investment as a driver of economic development, freed from the profit
imperative by soft-budget constraints. That strategy would have a major
influence on economic policy in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the prc, down
to the present; it explains the emergence of China’s byds as today’s
cutting-edge electric vehicles. In the 1920s, Soviet economists at
Gosplan and other bodies set about developing an /ex-ante/ plan, based
on the prior allocation of inflows to match desired outflows. They had
to grapple with the daunting task of quantifying millions of inputs,
multiple types of material, different generations of machinery and
dispersed labour resources, in order to bring them into equilibrium
across the whole economy. With the launch of the first Five-Year Plan in
1928, the Soviet Union lurched into a more haphazard but undoubtedly
more dynamic form of coordination, on top of this central-allocation model.

Indeed, the Five-Year Plans are best understood as motivational
projects, rather than plans as such. Their goals became increasingly
extreme, producing a set of perverse results: extensive waste, shoddy
products, Soviet managers hoarding or bartering hard-to-get inputs, in
an attempt to meet impossible output quotas.footnote^15 <#note-15> But
these absurdities were nevertheless outweighed by the sheer scale of the
growth in productive capacity, with end results far beyond what anyone
could have predicted. This was in large part achieved by pouring the
rural labour force into rapidly built factories, following the
notoriously brutal collectivization of agriculture. From 1932, it was
also fuelled by a radical monetary innovation. The national currency,
the rouble, was administratively divided into two distinct circuits of
value with the state bank, Gosbank, as gatekeeper. The cash rouble, for
salaries and consumption, entered circulation when workers received
their wages and exited again when they purchased goods from stores. The
non-cash rouble was used exclusively within the planning and production
system, serving as an accounting mechanism for all state-enterprise
transactions—tokens of permission within the planned economy’s
administrative logic. Non-cash roubles were created through credit
authorizations and deleted when plans were fulfilled or
adjusted.footnote^16 <#note-16> Without the extraordinary industrial
dynamism this system produced, it would have been impossible for the
Soviet Union to defeat Nazi Germany.

Stalinism was a disaster from a moral, social and political perspective—
and, in the long run, from an economic perspective, too. But in the
short to medium term, its developmental achievements are undeniable.
After the devastation of the Second World War, Soviet growth resumed for
a further two decades; the ussr’s innovations included the hydrogen bomb
and putting the first man into space. Its expansionary dynamic only
faltered in the mid-1960s as the supply of labour from the countryside
finally ran out.footnote^17 <#note-17> Despite all its problems, the
Soviet system achieved a basic level of economic security for its
population, with strong job protections, higher-grade employment for
women, public childcare and a cradle-to-grave welfare state. But once it
began to run short of resources, the heavily centralized economy proved
unable to re-tool itself or to implement innovations such as the linear-
programming algorithm developed by the Soviet economist Kantorovich in
1938. As growth slowed, the contradictions of the model became
increasingly obvious.

Long-term structural problems—chronic stagnation, productivity decline,
falling oil revenues—were already constraining the Soviet economy. But
the proximate cause of collapse was the breakdown of the internal
separation between the cash and non-cash monetary circuits, as
enterprise reforms in the late 1980s expanded managerial discretion and
allowed firms to engage in market-oriented transactions, undermining
Gosbank’s monopoly on financial coordination. Firms used cash earnings
to pay bonuses, procure scarce inputs, or build parallel distribution
channels. As financial discipline broke down, inter-enterprise arrears
ballooned, non-cash payments failed to clear and material flows became
untrackable. The system’s core function—allocating resources through
plan-validated ledger entries—was no longer operable.footnote^18 <#note-18>

In practice, then, the centralized plan—focused above all on output
growth—came to stand in for the multi-criterial community-regulated
economy for which the mass socialist parties had been fighting,
attempting to manage a level of production far more complex than the
1840s communists could have imagined. It may be helpful here to unpack
the theory of the plan—and its limitations—before going on to examine
the alternative approaches that were being debated in Vienna in the
1920s, just as Gosplan was starting work in Moscow.


      3. the theory of the plan

The classic case for /ex-ante/ planning foregrounds the conscious
organization of production to meet collective needs, instead of letting
market prices adjust supply and demand after the fact, generating
chaotic booms and busts, waste and inefficiencies.footnote^19 <#note-19>
As noted, the logic of /ex-ante/ planning proved especially compelling
for large-scale transformations that require coherent, long-term
coordination—industrial development, but also any serious move to
replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, or to eliminate plastics.
But the argument for /ex-ante/ planning was also tied to an account of
social justice. Under capitalism, income distribution becomes a terrain
of struggle between labour and capital, shaping the choice of production
techniques at every level.footnote^20 <#note-20> /Pace/ the mainstream
economics textbooks, capitalists do not merely organize production
around economic efficiency; they structure it to sustain managerial
control, often at the expense of efficiency, as well as broader social
needs.footnote^21 <#note-21> From the days of Bebel and Kautsky onward,
socialists argued that a rationally planned economy would eliminate
these politically motivated distortions. It would be based on an
objective assessment of social needs, productive capacities and the
labour time required to produce every good and service, with precise
accounting that would make exploitation impossible. From this
perspective, the political dimension of production disappears along with
class conflict, so planning becomes a purely technical process.

From the 1870s, socialists mainly looked to labour-time accounting to
operationalize this vision. Drawing on Marx’s scattered suggestions that
a socialist economy would still require calculations of socially
necessary labour time to coordinate production, this approach treats
labour as the fundamental unit of value.footnote^22 <#note-22> In
theory, all inputs—raw materials, fixed capital and labour itself—can be
converted into labour-time equivalents, allowing socialist planners to
determine precisely how the workforce should be allocated in response to
shifting social needs and technological developments.footnote^23
<#note-23> On this basis, labour would be slotted into all branches of
production in advance, without any market exchange—and hence without the
formation of ‘values’, understood as ratios of market exchange between
commodities. This framework also claimed to resolve the problem of
exploitation by ensuring that each contributes ‘according to their
ability’—and can understand their contribution transparently, measured
in socially determined labour units—whether they then access consumption
goods and services according to ‘their contribution’ or ‘their need’.

Soviet economists soon discovered the limits of labour-time accounting.
Reducing everything to labour hours oversimplifies key distinctions
between different types of work and resources. A more practical approach
emerged: measuring each input in its own natural units—tons of steel,
kilowatt-hours of electricity, or hours of engineering versus care
labour. Input-output models, pioneered by Wassily Leontief and
operationalized by Leonid Kantorovich through the introduction of
linear-programming techniques, mapped production through detailed
matrices that took as parameters the ‘recipes’ for each good and
service, showing precisely which inputs were required to produce each
output. Input-output planning is computationally intensive but highly
adaptable; there are good reasons to think it will be useful in a world
facing tight ecological constraints.footnote^24 <#note-24>

However, /ex-ante/ planning models face core problems. In practical
terms, the first of these is the generation of a coherent plan. Under
capitalism, firms are incentivized to discover the most efficient
methods for producing goods and services. Planned economies, by
contrast, must draft the ‘recipes’ of production administratively.
Engels and Bebel claimed these could be ‘easily determined’, and
Marxists generally followed this assumption. But the Soviet experience
soon showed that things were not so easy. Firms producing the same goods
and services often operated different combinations of machinery, built
at different times, maintained in different ways and upgraded to
different degrees, resulting in different operational norms—the ‘vintage
problem’.footnote^25 <#note-25> As a result, producers might reasonably
disagree about the optimal production method for their industry and
their real resource needs might vary quite substantially. Divergences
were compounded by differences in geography, custom, access to
infrastructure and local resource availability, making it hard to impose
uniform benchmarks without distorting production. A second set of
practical problems concerned implementation. /Ex-ante/ planning theory
assumed that a well-constructed plan would in itself ensure smooth
execution. Yet disruptions—delayed inputs, logistical failures, shifts
in demand—often required /ex-post/ adjustments which the plan struggled
to accommodate, especially when it was tightly specified. Market
economies, despite their inefficiencies, incorporate built-in feedback
loops that allow continuous adaptation. They create space for
experimentation and innovation, enabling firms to test new methods,
respond to failure and evolve—or die—in ways that central plans do not
easily permit.

But the planning model also suffered from a deeper theoretical
limitation: it remained efficiency-first. Both labour-time accounting
and input-output models reduce economic coordination to a technical
exercise, oriented towards the optimization of input use—whether
measured in hours worked or heterogeneous resources—to maximize desired
output. Planning, in this view, becomes a single-criterion optimization
problem: production targets are defined, inputs are calculated, and an
algorithm generates a comprehensive map of resource flows across the
economy. Other social goals—such as limiting carbon emissions or
improving work quality—can be incorporated into these frameworks, but
only as external constraints, not as core objectives. Even when multiple
goals are acknowledged, they are not treated as independent criteria
worth pursuing for their own sake. Instead, the system seeks the ‘least-
cost’ way to meet its primary objective—usually maximum output—while
staying within specified limits. The result is a framework that retains
the efficiency-first logic that a multi-criterial economy would try to
transcend.

Adherence to a ‘single-objective function’ logic marked a fundamental
limit of traditional planning approaches. While efficiency remains
important—wastefulness is not a goal—a genuinely multi-criterial
economy, capable of meeting the needs of all and underwriting the free
development of each, would need to incorporate a broader array of core
priorities, worth pursuing for their own sake. In addition to meeting
basic needs, these could include sustainability—respecting ecological
limits, promoting restoration, for example; work quality—fostering
meaningful rather than degrading labour; experimental research and
education; cultural production; community cohesion or autonomy;
aesthetic goals. The shift required is not merely from a labour theory
of value to a broader input-output framework, but from a monistic theory
of value to a pluralistic alternative—and, as a result, from a technical
to a political understanding of economic coordination.

This reorientation has far-reaching implications. In most planning
models, political contestation enters—if at all—only at the stage of
determining social needs, as a basis for deciding what should be
produced. Once these have been established, the rest of the plan is
treated as a technical problem: of calculating which inputs are
required, in what proportions and using which methods, to produce those
outputs. Democracy enters planning at this point only in a narrow,
supervisory and administrative role: workers may be brought in to make
sure that everyone is contributing fairly—a safeguard against
exploitation—and to ensure that the machinery of administration does not
fall under the control of a technical elite—a safeguard against
domination. But the plan itself is assumed to be neutral. This manner of
proceeding assumes that each good has a single optimal ‘recipe’—an
assumption undermined not only by the practicalities of the ‘vintage
problem’, but more fundamentally by the fact that different production
techniques embody different ethical and political values. Even for a
single good or service, multiple production methods will always be
possible, depending on whether the priorities are efficiency, quality,
sustainability, good working conditions or some other combination of
values.

A multi-criterial economy would treat those choices as ethical and
political, with different production methods reflecting different ways
of balancing society’s multiple goals. The same openness to adjudicated
multiplicity would need to extend across the economy as a whole,
creating a system in which coordination is not about discovering a
singular optimal path but navigating trade-offs between competing
priorities. The process of aggregating these choices—determining how to
allocate labour, materials and investment across society’s many goals—
would no longer be reducible to a fixed algorithm but would remain a
site of democratic contention, shifting with evolving social and
political priorities.


      4. values and value

A theory of value that seeks to explain economic worth through a single
metric—whether utility or labour time—cannot capture the complexity of a
system governed by competing priorities. What we need instead is a
theory of /values/: one that recognizes economic life as structured by
multiple aims.footnote^26 <#note-26> Marx’s work contains a tension that
speaks directly to the question of how economic coordination might be
organized in this way. The early chapters of /Capital: Volume One /align
closely with the logic of /ex-ante/ planning described above. Marx
criticizes the way markets validate labour as socially useful only /ex
post/. In a capitalist economy, he explains, private producers make
independent decisions about what and how to produce, with no guarantee
that their labours will be recognized as socially necessary. Only the
act of exchange—if and when their goods or services are sold—affirms
their private labour as having social value. This system of /ex-post/
social validation generates considerable uncertainty, and would do so
even in the absence of class divisions. Producers cannot know in advance
whether their efforts will count as meaningful, and hence rewardable,
contributions. Their labour may be rendered socially useless by
overproduction, unexpected shifts in demand or technological changes
that cannot be reliably anticipated.footnote^27 <#note-27>

The market’s retrospective validation process also entrenches a system
in which labour is disconnected from any conscious, collective
determination of what and how to produce. In brief references to the
economic organization of socialism, Marx contrasted this aspect of the /
ex-post/ validation system to that of /ex-ante/ coordination, where
labour is allocated according to a collective plan.footnote^28
<#note-28> Even if the products of their labour ultimately go unused,
the producers’ work will still count as socially valid, since it has
been undertaken according to agreed-upon priorities. The loss would be
socialized rather than individualized. Marx’s thinking here aligns with
traditional planning models that emphasized systematic accounting—
whether through labour-time measures or input-output matrices—as an
antidote to the market’s chaotic /ex-post/ procedure.

However, there is another strand of thought in /Capital: Volume One/
that moves towards a deeper critique of capitalist production. In his
discussion of the ‘general law of capitalist accumulation’, Marx
described how capitalist firms, driven to raise productivity by the
competitive pursuit of profit, depleted natural resources, reduced
workers to fragments of men and compromised product quality—all because
production was subordinated to the imperative of maximizing profit,
which was achieved by maximizing economic efficiency.footnote^29
<#note-29> This suggests that socialism cannot simply be about replacing
market coordination with planned coordination, while retaining
efficiency-first as a core logic. A socialist alternative must also
transform the values embedded in production itself. Marx’s work thus
implies not just a ‘theory of value’, but a broader theory of /values/,
in which economic coordination is structured around multiple priorities.

Twenty-first-century Marxists and democratic socialists have drawn on
this strand in Marx’s work to criticize capitalism for systematically
excluding crucial values—care, health, sustainability, work quality,
social cohesion. They rightly tie this to the exclusion of the vast
majority of humanity from participation in economic decision-
making.footnote^30 <#note-30> If those masses were included, there is no
chance that they would put capitalist profitability above every other
goal. The answer therefore appears to be straightforward: extend
decision-making power to those previously excluded, integrate neglected
values into planning models, and construct an economy that better
reflects the full range of human aspirations. But this solution risks
moving too swiftly over the real material, cultural and political
differences at stake. It typically depends on what might be called an /
additive /theory of value, which assumes that integrating excluded
values is primarily a matter of expanding informational inputs—learning
more about people’s needs, to refine the planning process.footnote^31
<#note-31> On this view, planning remains a largely technical exercise
of converging on the best solution, only now it is achieved through
discussion rather than mathematical calculation.

The history of socialist thought provides many examples of this
‘additive’ approach. Consider the 1890s debate between Edward Bellamy
and William Morris over the nature of a future society. In /Looking
Backward/ (1888), the American novelist envisaged a future where private
ownership has been abolished and production reorganized to achieve
unprecedented levels of efficiency, unlocking the full potential of the
economy to produce abundance and a life of leisure.footnote^32
<#note-32> The English poet and artist strongly rejected this narrow,
efficiency-first vision in his utopian response, /News from Nowhere/.
Morris offered an alternative vision of socialism, organized around a
broader set of human needs, whose goal was not simply more abundance and
less toil, but meaningful, fulfilling work producing beautiful
goods.footnote^33 <#note-33>

Yet Morris’s critique illustrates precisely the limitation of the
additive approach. Although he sought to incorporate additional values,
he did not address the problems this would entail for the economic
decision-making process. The only concrete decision-making structure
discussed in /News from Nowhere/ is the Mote, an informal meeting at
which members of a local community regularly gather to discuss such
issues as, in Morris’s telling, whether to build a new bridge now or
wait a little longer. These decisions appear modest in scope and largely
uncontentious—matters of common sense rather than political
disagreement.footnote^34 <#note-34> In the next generation, Morris would
be a major influence on the left-Fabian G. D. H. Cole, whose theory of
guild socialism developed Morris’s intuitions into a much more elaborate
vision of a society organized around multiple values—but again, in an
additive sense. In Cole’s /Guild Socialism Restated/ (1920), people are
organized in terms of three overlapping roles: as workers, consumers and
citizens. These identities correspond to three institutional spheres,
each with its own representative bodies, which come together to
negotiate prices and coordinate production. Karl Polanyi, a close
associate of Cole in the 1930s, developed what might be seen as his own
variant of guild socialism.footnote^35 <#note-35> Yet for all their
architectural richness, these models share a core assumption that, once
the full range of voices and perspectives is included, consensus will
not be hard to reach. Conflict is presumed to fade away, without needing
to be institutionalized and navigated.

This additive theory of value persists in more recent socialist
traditions as well.footnote^36 <#note-36> We find it wherever thinkers
seem to assume that including more people, perspectives, interests and
values in economic decision-making will naturally lead to greater social
harmony. On this view, economic antagonisms under capitalism arise
primarily from domination—those with power impose decisions on those
without. Exclusion of people and values is seen as the root cause of
social conflict. The implication is that, after capitalism, politics
will wither away as consensus will take hold. But this framework
systematically avoids the deeper challenge: incorporating multiple
values requires new procedures for managing real differences over trade-
offs.footnote^37 <#note-37> Stalinism understood these clashes of
interest well and dealt with them by brute force, waging economic war on
the peasantry to impose the values of the cities and the industrializing
Soviet state. If differences are instead to be dealt with
democratically, adapting the ideals of the older community-regulated
visions of socialism to a far more complex socio-economic order, then
that political process needs to be foregrounded—it cannot simply be left
to the future’s cooks. Capitalism suppresses value conflicts in
production by enforcing its efficiency-first logic. Incorporating a
plurality of production values will mean transforming the process of
choosing among competing economic priorities, not simply expanding
informational inputs.


      5. neurath’s breakthrough

One of the few interwar thinkers to grasp the challenge that multi-
criterial decision-making would pose to traditional planning models was
the Viennese polymath, Otto Neurath. Tall and outspoken, Neurath was a
commanding figure in the city’s pre-1934 intellectual life.footnote^38
<#note-38> Trained in maths, physics and economic history in Vienna and
Berlin, he was also schooled in the practicalities of wartime economic
improvisation, which he observed close up during the Balkan conflicts of
1912–13, before running logistics for the Austro-Hungarian Army on the
Galician front in the First World War. There he witnessed the ‘money-
oriented trade economy’ start to give way to a centralized
‘administrative economy’, bringing improved life conditions but also a
regrettable uniformity:

    If the administrative economy . . . does actually make better use of
    available effort, abolishing unemployment, making crises impossible
    and diminishing mass poverty, it will doubtless take some time
    before an incisive criticism is raised against the uniformity. But
    the wish for co-existence of different forms of life and
    organization would then show itself more forcefully perhaps than
    ever before, and it might not be impossible that a multiplicity of
    forms of life adapted to the multiplicity of men themselves should
    become a mark of the future next-but-one.footnote^39 <#note-39>

Radicalized by the collapse of the Habsburg, Hohenzollern and Romanov
empires, Neurath was among those trying to build a new society amid the
rubble, leading moves for the socialization of the economy in the run-up
to the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic of 1919. After it was
crushed he was deported back to Austria, where he played a key part in
urban planning and popular education in Red Vienna—as well as
stimulating Ludwig von Mises to launch the Socialist Calculation
Debate.footnote^40 <#note-40>

Neurath rejected the notion that a socialist economy should optimize for
a single goal—whether maximizing output or minimizing labour time—and
insisted that taking multiple, often conflicting values seriously
required rethinking economic coordination itself. Planning could no
longer be understood as a technical process for selecting the best
solution. It had to be re-conceived as a democratic procedure for
navigating among divergent priorities. In 1920s Vienna, for instance, a
municipal-planning body tasked with solving a housing shortage might
face competing objectives: minimize costs or maximize liveability. No
technical model could resolve the trade-off between plans for building
as many units as possible, quickly and cheaply, as opposed to
foregrounding green space, light and sanitation, albeit at a slower pace
and higher cost. The choice was not a matter of input-output
optimization; it was a political question about which values to choose
and why.footnote^41 <#note-41>

As he pointed out in /Der Kampf/, theoretical journal of the Austrian
Social Democrats, the socialist economy was concerned with ‘the interest
of the social whole’—‘the welfare of all its members with regard to
housing, food, clothing, health, entertainment, etc.’:

    Right at the start it must be determined what this is, ‘the interest
    of the social whole’. Does it include the prevention of the
    premature exhaustion of the coal mines or of the karstification of
    the mountains or, for instance, of the health and strength of the
    next generation? Once that has been determined at least in outline,
    it makes sense to ask how the existing raw materials, machines,
    labour power, etc., are best used. One has to find the best way to
    achieve a non-wasteful exploitation of the coal mines, to ensure the
    health of the next generation.footnote^42 <#note-42>

Under capitalism, Neurath argued, such trade-offs are obscured:
questions about the kinds of work, environment or communities we want
are framed as if they had purely technical answers, creating a false
sense of clarity about the route ahead. Once a plurality of values is
acknowledged, planning no longer delivers a single optimal path for the
economy. Choice across alternatives becomes essential.

Neurath recognized that many would find this conclusion difficult to
accept. A dominant assumption in modern scientific thinking—including
socialist thinking—is that uncertainty can always be reduced with better
information: that, given enough data, all options can be ranked. Neurath
called this belief pseudo-rationalism: the tendency to begin with the
assumption that a single best solution to any problem can always be
uncovered, and then to rationalize one’s choice, after the fact, as
having been the best.footnote^43 <#note-43> Pseudo-rationalists
construct myths of necessity rather than engaging in true forms of
reasoning. True rationalism, Neurath argued, begins by acknowledging
that a fundamental uncertainty cannot be eliminated. There are two
sources of such uncertainty. First, we face uncertainty about the facts:
we do not fully understand the present and cannot reliably predict the
future. Second, we face uncertainty about our values: even well-defined
values do not have fixed or stable trade-off relationships, and our
priorities will tend to change over time. These uncertainties mean that
economic planning cannot be fully predictive or entirely technical.
Instead, ‘we must in principle give several answers, since because of
our inadequate insight into the presuppositions of events, several
possibilities present themselves to us’.footnote^44 <#note-44>

For Neurath, recognizing this dual uncertainty leads to a rejection of
money as an instrument of economic coordination. Money, he argued, is a
pseudo-rational device: it creates the illusion that all outcomes can be
rendered commensurate through a single unit of account, masking the
presence of genuine uncertainty about both facts and values. Society
experiences the failure of this illusion in violent ways—through
financial crises—and in more mundane ones, as people routinely make
trade-offs between, say, higher incomes and better-quality work, or
between economic growth and environmental sustainability, without ever
confronting these as explicit choices. To overcome this irrational form
of rationality, Neurath argued that a socialist economy should adopt
‘calculation in kind’. This would involve evaluating economic plans both
quantitatively and qualitatively, but without measuring everything in
terms of a single unit. Calculation in kind would also acknowledge that
experts have only a limited ability to make our choices for us on
technical grounds. Given fundamental uncertainties about both facts and
values, experts cannot uncover strictly optimal outcomes; at best, they
can help identify a range of such options from which choices can be
made. Recognizing that uncertainty limits our ability to rank our
options is not a failure of planning, Neurath insisted, but a necessary
precondition for it in a democratic society. In the presence of partial-
order problems, democracy becomes not just desirable but essential.

Most accounts of economic planning assign a narrow role to democratic
deliberation: it either confirms the option already identified by
technical-optimization algorithms, or it enacts this optimization by way
of a consensus-oriented discussion. On this view, deliberation adds
little beyond allowing people to choose the ‘best’ option for
themselves, while also introducing the risk that they might choose
incorrectly. This is typically justified on two grounds: either because
democracy is believed to improve technical decision-making by
incorporating additional information—with inclusion leading to a more
optimal result—or because it serves as a safeguard against the
concentration of power: the republican concern with non-domination. But
if uncertainty is structural, and applies not only to facts but to
values, then the justification for democracy must be of a different
kind. Neither technical reasoning nor community deliberation can be
expected to converge on a single correct solution. What is needed, then,
is not democracy as a source of better inputs or oversight, but
democracy as a legitimate procedure for choosing among competing,
incommensurable options. For Neurath, democracy meant creating a process
through which people can collectively determine their future in a real
way, rather than a matter of consultation or limited representation.

Neurath’s concrete proposals for this involved a central office for
calculation in kind, where experts, or ‘social engineers’, would develop
comprehensive plans that dramatized the alternatives on which the public
needed to decide. As he explained to the plenary session of the Munich
Workers’ Council in January 1919, the plans would highlight the real
differences between the paths society could take:

    From these economic plans the people’s representatives should be
    able to infer what sort of qualitative shifts would occur if dams
    are built, if all manure pits are cemented and the like, within the
    framework of the total economy. The significance and realizability
    of each individual measure would become clear from looking at the
    whole.footnote^45 <#note-45>

One plan might prioritize environmental sustainability, another might
emphasize reduced working hours, while a third could focus on improving
work quality. Once these plans were presented, the public would have to
navigate perceived trade-offs through democratic deliberation, followed
by a vote. Neurath envisaged this process using in-kind units instead of
monetary prices, with the plans mapping the economy as a set of direct
physical relationships—how much food sustains a population; how many
theatre tickets might contribute to a richer life. This would involve
novel forms of public education. Neurath duly developed the isotype
system, a visual language to help a semi-numerate and even semi-literate
population inform themselves about economic choices. His goal was not
merely to inform but to empower, ensuring that economic coordination
reflected collective aspirations rather than technocratic
proclivities.footnote^46 <#note-46>


      6. on socialist calculation

The question of whether it was possible to implement Neurath’s vision of
a moneyless economy became a central point of contention in the interwar
Socialist Calculation Debate. The polemics, which drew in some of the
era’s leading economists—Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Oskar Lange,
Abba Lerner—revolved around whether rational economic organization was
possible without monetary price signals.footnote^47 <#note-47> ‘Since
recent events [i.e., the First World War] have helped socialist parties
to obtain power in Russia, Hungary, Germany and Austria, and thus made
the execution of a socialist nationalization programme a topical
issue, Marxist writers have themselves begun to deal more closely with
the problems of the regulation of the socialist commonwealth’, Mises
noted, as he fired the first shot.footnote^48 <#note-48> Mises and Hayek
argued that central planners could never replicate the rationality
embedded in capitalist markets. Without real prices determined by
competitive producers seeking maximal profits, economic participants
would lack the information needed to make rational decisions about what
to produce and how.footnote^49 <#note-49>

Mises emphasized that prices allow economic actors—above all, investors—
not only to compare the cost of different production methods, but also
to determine whether producing a given good is worthwhile at all. Only
by comparing costs of inputs to the price of outputs could an actor
judge whether anticipated rates of return justified investment. In this
way, profitability served as both a signal of relative efficiency and a
threshold of social viability. Hayek deepened this argument by insisting
that price information alone was not enough. Rational production also
depended on the local and specific knowledge held by producers, who
understood which methods worked best with their equipment and
conditions. Full-scale planning, both warned, would lead to major
production inefficiencies. Instead of having more and working less,
people would end up having less and working more.footnote^50 <#note-50>

As the debate developed, Lange and Lerner attempted to counter these
criticisms by proposing a hybrid model which retained market-like
mechanisms within a planned economy.footnote^51 <#note-51> The Lange–
Lerner–Taylor model suggested that publicly managed firms could orient
themselves towards administratively set prices, simulating market
signals without needing profit-seeking private actors to discover prices
through competitive trial and error. A central planner would act as a
Walrasian auctioneer, announcing prices and then successively adjusting
them to bring supply and demand into balance. If a set of prices
resulted in overproduction of one type of input and underproduction of
another, then the price of the former would be lowered and the latter
raised. Other theorists proposed using non-price indices to achieve
similar outcomes.footnote^52 <#note-52> Some, inspired at least in part
by Neurath’s dream of an in-kind economy, experimented with input-output
tables and linear programming to coordinate production without relying
on prices at all.footnote^53 <#note-53>

Yet these approaches remained fixated on achieving what economists call
static equilibrium—the momentary balance between supply and demand—and
consequently struggled with the question of economic
dynamism.footnote^54 <#note-54> Lange and his followers demonstrated
that, under certain idealized assumptions, a planned economy could
indeed achieve static equilibrium without the profit-driven motivations
of private capitalists. But as Hayek argued, markets are not merely
allocation devices; they are adaptive, evolutionary systems. Genuine
market prices enable rapid, decentralized responses to unforeseen shifts
in input availability or consumer preferences, even when the underlying
causes remain obscure. Real markets also function as arenas of
experimentation, where firms can test alternative methods of production
and new products, discovering what works through consumer evaluation.
Markets, Hayek emphasized, are therefore places of dynamic discovery
rather than mere mechanisms for equilibrium-seeking. No centralized
planning system, he argued, could replicate this adaptive
capacity.footnote^55 <#note-55>

The static equilibrium Lange sought to achieve, Hayek pointed out, was
merely a theoretical fiction invented by neoclassical economists,
resting on the unrealistic assumption that technologies, consumer
preferences and economic conditions could be fully known in advance. In
reality, economic life is constantly in motion, driven by producers
testing different strategies under conditions of fundamental
uncertainty. The outcomes of these experiments—like the results of a
race—can only be discovered after they have taken place. Lange and his
followers had conceived of planning as an exercise in fine-tuning a
fixed, predetermined structure, rather than as a dynamic engagement with
uncertainty and flux.

Yet the deeper problem with the Lange–Lerner–Taylor model was not simply
their neglect of economic dynamism; it was that they implicitly accepted
the Austrian framework’s underlying assumptions. Instead of following
Neurath in challenging the premise that economies must be structured
around an efficiency-first logic, Lange and others conceded this terrain
by seeking to demonstrate that socialist planning could match or
approximate capitalist markets’ allocative efficiency. In accepting this
single-criterion definition of economic rationality, they remained
locked within a single-criterion optimization paradigm; non-efficiency
goals, when considered at all, appeared as either afterthoughts or
external constraints. Price-like models could only attempt to integrate
these broader goals through /ad hoc/ mechanisms, such as Pigouvian taxes
—adjusting prices to reflect social and environmental costs and
benefits.footnote^56 <#note-56>

These partial adjustments improved the inclusiveness of the planning
process, but they were inadequate as foundations for a genuinely dynamic
and adaptive multi-criterial economy. Such an economy would require
institutions capable of continuously evolving, dynamically integrating
multiple and often conflicting goals, and systematically encouraging
technological innovation aimed explicitly at diverse and shifting social
purposes. Neither Lange’s approach—nor any of its rival twentieth-
century planning models—delivered this kind of economic coordination.

Meanwhile, Neurath’s project, which offered a glimpse of what a
genuinely democratic and pluralistic economy might look like, remained
more of a critical intervention than a practical alternative. He assumed
that, in the near future, social engineers would be able to generate a
range of planning options by applying multi-criterial evaluations to
vast detailed input-output tables. In reality, the computational burden
and interpretive demands of such a task—even for a single plan, let
alone many—rendered this vision technically unfeasible and
institutionally underspecified.footnote^57 <#note-57> What Neurath
lacked—and what the broader socialist tradition never supplied—was a
concrete model for turning these normative insights into a workable
system, capable of integrating technological possibilities and evolving
social values over time.


      7. plans and markets

While the Socialist Calculation Debate played out primarily in theory,
its practical counterpart emerged concretely after the War in the
centrally planned economies of the Soviet Bloc. As we have seen, Soviet
planners never attempted to realize Neurath’s multi-dimensional
democratic project; their economy was structured along highly
centralized commandist lines. Nevertheless, like Neurath, they believed
that economic life could be rationally coordinated without market price
signals through comprehensive central plans. The subsequent history of
the ussr revealed the limits of this mechanism; as an institutional
foundation for non-market coordination, central planning ultimately
failed. The problems predicted by Mises and Hayek—information
bottlenecks, coordination failures, rigidities in adapting to change—
became painfully familiar.

Yet it would be wrong to conclude that the entire Soviet economic
experiment was a failure. The Austrian economists were correct about the
static inefficiencies of non-market resource allocation, but they
underestimated the dynamism that central planning could achieve. For a
quarter of a century, between the 1930s and the 1950s, the ussr was the
world’s fastest-growing major economy. Its ambitious system of
investment planning enabled rapid industrialization, extensive
infrastructure development and impressive capacity expansion across
interdependent sectors. In some industries, such as steel production,
Soviet plants became among the world’s most efficient due to their
immense scale.footnote^58 <#note-58> These accomplishments defied the
Austrian framework, which largely ignored the potential advantages of
economies of scale and coordinated investment. For a period, these gains
outweighed the costs of static misallocation; if Soviet planners
misallocated 5 per cent of output annually, but achieved overall growth
rates of 10 per cent, desired outputs still increased rapidly in
absolute terms. Yet as growth slowed, static inefficiencies became
increasingly pronounced.footnote^59 <#note-59>

Market economies offer firms direct interaction with suppliers: if a
supplier fails to meet their needs, firms seek alternative partners.
Central planning eliminated this crucial flexibility. Firms had to
accept whatever resources the central apparatus assigned, whether
appropriate or not. As we have seen, managers duly improvised solutions,
substituting lower-quality inputs or altering production processes on
the fly. Such makeshift adjustments frequently produced defective goods,
which failed to meet downstream requirements. Yet planned economies
lacked effective mechanisms to filter out underperforming firms; even
chronically inadequate suppliers continued receiving inputs, while other
plants sat idle awaiting necessary parts, then rushed production to meet
targets. These disruptions quickly propagated through rigidly structured
supply chains. In response, firms hoarded whatever inputs they could
secure—particularly labour—further exacerbating shortages. Such
practices initiated a downward spiral, progressively distorting the
planning data upon which resource allocation relied. Under these
conditions, black markets emerged not as anomalies but as integral
survival mechanisms, enabling firms to secure essential inputs and
maintain baseline productivity. Without these informal channels, many
industries would have struggled to function at all. Thus, the Soviet
experience revealed a deeper truth about central planning: while it
could successfully drive large-scale industrialization for a limited
period, it failed as a mechanism for sustained adaptive coordination in
a complex economy.footnote^60 <#note-60>

By the 1970s, many Soviet Bloc economists were coming to conclude that
markets were not merely necessary, but unavoidable. The market appeared
to provide precisely what central planning lacked: decentralized
coordination, discipline for underperforming firms, adaptability to
unexpected shifts and a sustainable framework for continuous innovation.
Yet historical evidence suggested that these virtues only emerged within
fully capitalist markets, where everyday economic activity was firmly
tied to investment organized around the pursuit of private profit. Pre-
capitalist markets, by contrast, lacked dynamism, as guild regulations
insulated producers from pressures to innovate.footnote^61 <#note-61>
Similarly, market reforms introduced by state-socialist economies—such
as Hungary’s New Economic Mechanism, launched in 1968—improved immediate
coordination but failed to sustain long-term innovation and growth.
Polish economists Włodzimierz Brus and Kazimierz Łaski observed that
market-oriented socialist firms had little incentive to innovate.
Economist János Kornai identified the cause as the persistence of ‘soft
budget constraints’: planners, unwilling to let firms fail, continued to
allocate resources to underperforming enterprises. Without the threat of
market discipline, firms faced no genuine pressure to improve
performance.footnote^62 <#note-62>

The lesson seemed clear: market dynamism depended upon profit-led
investment. If investment decisions were not guided by profitability,
markets would fail to drive efficiency and innovation. This conclusion
generated a series of attempts in the 1980s and 90s to reimagine a form
of market socialism; among the most influential was that of Yale
economist, John Roemer.footnote^63 <#note-63> Drawing on Brus, Łaski,
Kornai and Nove, Roemer accepted that dynamic economies require the
efficiency pressures imposed by profit-led investment. His solution was
to reconceive socialism as a Rawlsian project of distributive justice,
equalizing capital ownership across society. Capital would be
collectively owned and the income it generated would be equally
distributed through public institutions. Firms would still operate
according to market logic, competing to maximize monetary returns, but
the profits would accrue to the public rather than a capitalist
elite.footnote^64 <#note-64>

Eliminating the capitalists as a class would undoubtedly yield major
benefits. It would remove the primary source of economic inequality in
capitalism: the concentration of wealth and the income streams it
generates; a small group of wealthy actors would no longer dominate
campaign financing, lobbying or media ownership. Basic reforms—such as
full-employment policies or universal basic income—would no longer have
to work around the veto power of capital. In this sense, Roemer’s model,
like that of Lange and Taylor before it, offered a clear break with
capitalism’s social structure. But in economic substance, it preserved
capitalism’s logic. The issue was not the preservation of the market as
an allocator of resources. More deeply, it was that in Roemer’s model,
investment would still flow to projects expected to deliver the highest
financial return. Efficiency remained not one value among others, but
the overriding priority of the system. This would still be a poor
reflection of human needs and values. Despite its redistributive
ambitions, Roemer’s model remained trapped within the logic of the
system it sought to transcend. The democratic deliberation over
competing futures to which Neurath pointed was foreclosed.

What Neurath lacked was a fully developed theory of investment as a
political institution. Investment is not merely the expansion of
existing production lines; it is a dynamic, future-making process. Even
under capitalism, investment involves strategic decisions under
conditions of uncertainty—about which goals to pursue, what forms of
life to enable, and which trade-offs to accept.footnote^65 <#note-65>
Yet because investment remains tethered to profitability, these choices
are constrained, severely limiting the range of futures they can bring
into being. If investment fundamentally shapes society’s future
possibilities, then it must also become the primary site through which
democratic politics enters economic life.


      8. a missing marxist theory of investment

Why did the socialist tradition, for all its ambitions, never develop a
viable theory of investment as a democratically structured process? The
occlusion began with Marx himself. While he acknowledged that a post-
capitalist system would need to allocate part of its output for future
production, he left unexamined how that allocation would be made—or how
it might be directed towards evolving social goals. The result was a
tradition focused on one possible outcome of investment—the expansion of
production—without a theory of how investment decisions might be made
collectively and politically, as a way of shaping the future.

Part of the issue here is conceptual. Following the classical
economists, Marx focused primarily on the results of net investment—that
is, on the accumulation of capital—rather than the investment process
itself. His analysis emphasized distinctions such as constant versus
variable capital, or the division between Department I (producer goods)
and Department ii (consumer goods), set out in /Capital, Volume Two/.
Though Marx noted the distinction within Department I between fixed and
circulating capital, he treated it as epiphenomenal—of more concern to
capitalists than to analysts of the system taking a comprehensive
view.footnote^66 <#note-66> Yet this last distinction is really the
critical one. Fixed capital consists of investment goods: buildings,
structures, machines, tools and equipment. Investment is the process of
purchasing, upgrading and maintaining this fixed capital base. It
establishes the underlying infrastructure of production, determining
both what can be produced and how production takes place. Circulating
capital, by contrast, refers to intermediate inputs—the materials
consumed in production, required to keep operations running. These
intermediate inputs flow through, and depend upon, the fixed-capital
infrastructure. While not every adjustment in production requires
changes at this level, any significant transformation—towards greater
efficiency, sustainability or improved working conditions—typically
involves reshaping or renewing this infrastructural foundation.

In the 1870s, Marx seems to have recognized the need to focus on
investment as a distinct process that a socialist economy would have to
organize differently. In the second German edition of /Capital: Volume
One/ (1873), he acknowledged that a socialist economy would still need
to allocate a portion of its output each year for the ‘production of
fresh means of production’. In ‘The Critique of the Gotha Programme’
(1875), he mocked the idea that labour would be paid its full value
under socialism, pointing out that a share of total production would
always have to be set aside for the ‘replacement of the means of
production used up’ and for the ‘expansion of production’. However, he
never developed a fuller theory of investment under socialism—one
capable of performing the coordination functions that investment fulfils
under capitalism, while also incorporating goals of social
transformation into the organization of production. Had Marx developed a
theory of investment as a distinct and politically structured process,
he might have seen its potential to become the central arena of economic
coordination—the /ex-ante/ dimension of planning. Market exchange could
still handle the /ex-post /adjustments needed for flexibility and
feedback, but investment would determine the conditions under which
markets function.footnote^67 <#note-67> Most of the problems Marx
associated with markets—overproduction crises triggered by excessive
firm entry, instability driven by uncoordinated technological innovation
—are not intrinsic to exchange itself. They are failures of investment
coordination. If investment were planned differently, many of those
problems would not arise.footnote^68 <#note-68>

Neurath took a crucial step beyond Marx by recognizing that to organize
the economy around multiple values would require a change in the
structure of economic decision-making. He rejected the idea that
planning could simply add new goals to an otherwise technical process.
But like Marx, he failed to distinguish clearly between investment and
other aspects of production. As a result, he imagined that multi-
criterial coordination had to occur either at the micro-level of
individual firms—a solution he rejected, since it left unresolved the
problem of aggregating across firms—or at the macro-level of national
accounting, which quickly became too complex to implement. This left him
vulnerable to the criticisms raised in the Socialist Calculation
Debate.footnote^69 <#note-69> Instead, he should have looked to
investment, which is already the mechanism by which capitalism selects
its futures. Investment is where decisions are made, in conditions of
uncertainty, about outcomes that are, for that reason, not fully
comparable. It is the natural institutional site for the kind of
democratic procedure Neurath envisioned. And because investment in a
mature economy typically accounts for only 15–25 per cent of economic
activity, coordinating it politically does not require full-scale
planning. Yet it is this modest share that sets the direction of the
entire system.

Why, then, did no other Marxist develop a theory of investment as a
political process? The answer lies in how planning was understood. In
the socialist tradition, planning was usually seen not as an arena for
the articulation of disagreements but as a way to put an end to them,
both economically and politically. The theory of the plan promised
rational order in place of capitalist anarchy, social harmony in place
of class struggle. In this vision, investment became a purely technical
matter: the reproduction of existing production on an expanded scale. As
a result, Marxists tended to ignore the entrepreneurial, experimental,
forward-looking character of investment even under capitalism—the way it
reshapes the economic landscape by proposing new combinations of
technology, labour and purpose.footnote^70 <#note-70> Under capitalism,
these proposals are narrow in aim, filtered through the drive for
profit. But they are still ideas for change; they invent futures and
test limits. Had Marxists recognized that this creative dimension had to
carry over into any socialist future, they might have imagined socialist
investment differently: not just as a mechanism for expansion, but as a
form of social experimentation—a way of posing multiple futures and
deciding, collectively, which to pursue. That would have required
thinking about planning not as the extinguisher of disagreements, but as
a procedure for developing and clarifying them.

Instead, planning came to be seen as an end in itself, if not as
socialism’s very definition. Its promise of order was mistaken for the
realization of justice. But planning was always better understood as a
means to an end: to eliminate exploitation and build an economy capable
of serving a broader range of human goals. Those goals should be pursued
through whatever institutional arrangements work best. By rethinking
investment—and transforming how markets would then operate—it would be
possible both to abolish and to preserve the current mode of economic
life, raising it to a higher order of complexity. Such a system would
not assume that workers’ interests will converge on a single standard,
or that automation will eliminate the need for diverse skills, or that
administration will become simple—necessary assumptions for a purely
technical form of economic planning to appear viable. The system we are
describing here assumes, more realistically, that most processes will
continue to grow more complex over time—the technical demands of
production, the diversity of desired outputs and the plurality of world
outlooks people hold.


      9. keynes’s investment function

To rethink investment, then, we need to draw on insights from outside
the Marxist tradition. The pivotal figure here is Keynes, who developed
a sophisticated theory of investment: forward-looking, creative,
unfolding in the context of a fundamental uncertainty about the future.
Keynes was the missing participant in the Socialist Calculation
Debate.footnote^71 <#note-71> In contrast to both the Austrian
economists and the Marxists, he rejected the assumption that market
exchange inherently required an economy structured around private
profitability. For Keynes, market transactions and profit-driven
investment were analytically distinct, and his project for economic
transformation rested precisely on the separation between the two.
Rather than abolishing markets, as some of the Marxists proposed, or
defending the profit motive, as the Austrians did, Keynes sought to
socialize investment under the control of a public authority.footnote^72
<#note-72> The Keynes of socialized investment differs substantially
from the one most widely known today: the Keynes of aggregate-demand
management, whose legacy is associated primarily with short-term
stabilization policies, above all counter-cyclical fiscal adjustment, to
maintain full employment during economic downturns. But the Keynes of
the stimulus package represents only one facet of his thought. Less
familiar is the Keynes who saw deeper structural reform as essential and
called for a fundamental alteration in the processes and purposes of
investment to reshape the entire economy’s long-run trajectory.

Keynes’s socialization of investment did not imply public ownership of
all firms. Instead, it meant that the state would assume strategic
control over the level and direction of investment, with public and
semi-public institutions accounting for ‘two-thirds or three-quarters’
of total investment activity.footnote^73 <#note-73> Public authorities
would also exercise control over the investment plans of large
corporations, to ensure that these complemented public
priorities.footnote^74 <#note-74> Market exchange would continue to
structure everyday economic interactions and private firms would still
invest, but only within a framework whose direction was set by public
investment. In Keynes’s view, this reorganization of investment would
provide a foundation for lasting transformation. By maintaining
investment beyond the point at which private profitability would
naturally decline, the state would gradually erode the profit motive
itself. As the economy approached a condition of ‘capital saturation’,
both interest rates and profit rates would trend towards zero,
ultimately eliminating capital’s scarcity value.footnote^75 <#note-75>
In /The/ /General Theory/, Keynes explained that, although ‘in the
strict sense’ this ‘has never yet occurred, not even momentarily’, it
could likely be brought about within ‘twenty-five years or less’, once
the socialization of investment had taken place.footnote^76 <#note-76>
Keynes’s famous line about the ‘euthanasia of the rentier’ is rarely
quoted in full, for it links the extinction of rentierism to ‘the
euthanasia of the cumulative oppressive power of the capitalist to
exploit the scarcity-value of capital’. This, again, was to be achieved
by state action forcing ‘an increase in the volume of capital until it
ceases to be scarce’.footnote^77 <#note-77> Keynes’s economics thus
posed an implicit challenge to both market capitalism and central
planning: if capitalism’s core instability arose from its reliance on
private investment decisions, then replacing that mechanism with a
publicly governed investment function would fundamentally alter the
system without necessitating the abolition of markets.

For Keynes, the orchestration of public and private investment to
achieve these goals was—or should be—a technical rather than political
matter. He famously compared the future role of economists to that of
dentists, implying that once the correct procedures were identified,
implementing them would become almost routine. Yet Keynes’s technical
framing did not stem from a desire to organize the economy around a
single, overriding goal like efficiency or maximal output. On the
contrary, he anticipated a future where the drive for accumulation would
fade, allowing humanity to finally attend to its ‘real’ and ‘permanent’
problem: how to use freedom from economic necessity to live ‘wisely and
agreeably and well’.footnote^78 <#note-78> In singling out these three
values as distinct dimensions of the good life, Keynes clearly envisaged
a society organized around multiple ends. John Stuart Mill had imagined
something similar, nearly a century before. He looked forward to a post-
competitive society, ‘the stationary state’, in which the pursuit of
profit would give way to ‘the Art of Living’, in contrast to ‘the art of
getting on’.footnote^79 <#note-79> The resemblance between Mill’s
‘stationary state’ and Keynes’s projection of a fully invested economy
is striking—and surprisingly underexplored. Both imagined a world in
which the profit motive would fade and economic life would give way to
moral and cultural progress. But whereas Mill believed this
transformation might occur naturally, once demographic pressures were
addressed through family planning, Keynes—while making the same
demographic caveat—understood that the path to zero profit would be far
more turbulent, and that capital saturation could not be achieved
without deliberate and sustained public intervention.

Yet both Mill and Keynes operated with what I have called an additive
theory of value: the assumption that incorporating additional goals into
economic life enriches decision-making but does not fundamentally
complicate it. From this perspective, the transition from single-
criterion capitalism to multi-dimensional prosperity could unfold
smoothly, as non-economic values simply became additional inputs—factors
integrated by experts into economic or investment planning. In this
framing, pluralism appears primarily as a technical problem rather than
a political one. But Keynes’s (and Mill’s) additive conception of value
misses a crucial difficulty. As we have seen, the coordination of plural
values cannot be delegated solely to experts or reduced to technical
implementation; it involves irreducibly political choices. Keynes’s
important ideas about the structural institution of a post-capitalist
investment function will need to be significantly repurposed if
investment is to be treated in a properly democratic fashion from the
outset. That will require structures that are open and accountable, as
decentralized as possible and capable of clarifying disagreement at
every level, rather than suppressing it beneath a veneer of technocratic
expertise.

Marxists have often dismissed Keynes for a different reason, charging
that he overlooked the fundamental political cleavage at capitalism’s
core: the class struggle over income distribution which shapes all
economic institutions into mechanisms of class domination. In /The
General Theory/, Keynes assumes that wages correspond to the marginal
productivity of labour—that once full employment is achieved, the wage
structure would be technically determined and self-stabilizing. On this
view, worker demands beyond that equilibrium wage level are not
expressions of reasonable political agency but threats to macroeconomic
stability. It is because Keynes did not see wages as a political problem
that he focused his attention so intensely on investment as the core
dysfunction of capitalism.footnote^80 <#note-80>

Here, too, crucial differences separate Keynes from Marx. Both see
capitalism as tending towards falling profit rates: in the absence of
sufficient technological dynamism, the accumulation of capital leads to
excess supply relative to demand, putting downward pressure on financial
returns. But whereas Marx sees this tendency as a compulsive feature of
capitalist accumulation—a dynamic that drives overproduction and
precipitates periodic crises—Keynes interprets the problem not as
overproduction but underinvestment. The issue, from his perspective, is
not that capitalists invest too much, with over-capacity leading to
falling profit rates, but that they invest too little to fully utilize
society’s productive resources. With sustained public action, he argued,
investment could be raised to a level that not only maintains full
resource utilization—ensuring full employment—but also, as discussed
above, gradually forces the rate of return on investment down to zero.
At that point, only those investments undertaken out of entrepreneurial
initiative, technical interest or social purpose would continue.

Keynes was of course correct to suggest that even during apparent
periods of overproduction, investment driven by non-profit motivations
would stimulate demand, helping bring the economy closer to full
employment. This insight underpinned his central policy prescription:
since private capitalists frequently fail to invest enough to maintain
full employment, governments should intervene to meet the shortfall. Yet
Keynes did not seriously consider the political resistance such a
programme would inevitably encounter—from capitalists relying on
unemployment as a disciplinary tool over labour, and from workers who,
once strengthened by sustained full employment, might leverage their
improved bargaining position to push wages higher and hence politicize
income distribution.footnote^81 <#note-81> Instead, Keynes treated the
pursuit of full employment as a straightforward technical improvement
that would benefit all; it remaining unrealized only because society
clung to outdated ideas—not because those ideas served powerful and
still present interests.footnote^82 <#note-82>


      10. functional finance

Nevertheless, Keynes’s insight opens up a vital avenue for economic
transformation. He allows us to rethink the fundamental relationship
between money and the productive economy by distinguishing between
nominal constraints—balanced budgets, debt limits—and the real
constraints posed by actual productive capacity: the availability of
labour, capital and raw materials. Another way of expressing Keynes’s
core insight: the real limit on economic activity is not financial but
material. As long as there are idle resources, the state can and should
spend—regardless of its current fiscal position. As Keynes famously put
it: ‘Anything we can actually /do/ we can afford. Once done, it is
there.’ It was possible to build a New Jerusalem ‘out of the labour
which in our former vain folly we were keeping unused and unhappy in
enforced idleness.’footnote^83 <#note-83> Public spending does not crowd
out private activity; it mobilizes what would otherwise remain idle. In
such conditions, money is not a scarce input but a coordinating tool.

This insight was later formalized by Abba Lerner as the theory of
functional finance. Lerner argued that the state does not need to raise
taxes or issue debt to ‘pay for’ public spending. What matters is not
where the money comes from, but what the spending does—whether it
mobilizes unused capacity or pushes the economy beyond its real
limits.footnote^84 <#note-84> This perspective recasts the relationship
between taxation and public spending—and, crucially, between savings and
investment. In mainstream economic thought, taxes are seen as the
necessary precondition for public spending: governments must first
collect revenue before they can finance expenditures. In the Keynesian
framework, the same sequence can just as easily be read the other way
around. Public spending increases production and income, which then
generate the tax revenues needed to balance the system. Taxes in this
view need not fund state spending in advance; they could equally be used
to modulate purchasing power after the fact—to prevent inflation. The
same interpretive flexibility applies to the relationship between
savings and investment. In standard accounts, savings are seen as a pool
from which investment is drawn. But Keynes shows that investment can
come first: it raises output and incomes, and those higher incomes are
then partially saved. From this perspective, savings are a residual. In
both cases, causality can be seen as flowing in either direction. What
matters is how we interpret the coordination of the system—and what role
public authority has in managing it.

Keynes’s insight that investment can precede and create savings helps
illuminate the underlying logic of state-directed industrialization. The
Soviet Union’s ability to launch its Five-Year Plans did not depend on
forcing peasants to save in advance, as Bukharin and Preobrazhensky
assumed it must; instead, the state simply began mobilizing
underemployed labour for industrial projects.footnote^85 <#note-85>
Workers were paid in money, but because the investment share of output
rose rapidly, much of this income could not be spent on consumption
goods and was effectively saved. A similar logic underpinned wartime
economic mobilization in the United States and Britain. There, too,
governments expanded production not by drawing on pre-existing private
savings, but by directly allocating real resources and issuing money as
needed—encouraging households to save after the fact through the sale of
war bonds. In both cases, the real constraint was not financial but
material: as long as factories, workers and raw materials could be
organized, the economy could expand without inflationary consequences.

This shift in thinking also marks a broader transformation in what value
accounting is meant to achieve. In traditional socialist models,
accounting systems are designed to track the precise creation of value,
often in labour time or physical quantities, in order to guide
allocation and prevent exploitation. Keynesian theory, by contrast,
reflects an adaptation to the complexity of modern industrial economies,
where production involves large overheads, scale effects and systemic
interdependence. In this setting, isolating individual contributions
becomes increasingly difficult, and the purpose of accounting changes.
Rather than serving as a basis for exact allocation, statistics become
tools for macroeconomic coordination: monitoring capacity, identifying
bottlenecks and ensuring that investment and consumption remain within
real resource limits. The aim is no longer to calculate who contributes
what, but to guide long-term planning in the face of ongoing
uncertainty.footnote^86 <#note-86>

However, even with an advanced statistical apparatus, there are many
reasons why functional finance is difficult to implement in a capitalist
economy, structured around the accumulation of private wealth.
Proponents of functional finance often point out that a government is
not a household or a firm; the state can spend more than it receives in
tax revenue and print money to buy its own debt. As long as recipients
spend the money, the result should be increased demand, higher output
and, eventually, full employment.footnote^87 <#note-87> But in an
economy organized around private accumulation, where money functions
both as a means of exchange and as a store of value, there is no
guarantee that recipients of government spending will put that money
back into circulation. Governments may not need to manage their balance
sheets, but households and firms do. When economic actors can choose to
prioritize financial security—paying down debt, building reserves,
buying financial assets—new spending may simply strengthen private
balance sheets, instead of stimulating demand.

This helps explain why, in Japan after 1991 or in the United States
after 2008, large-scale public stimulus failed to generate full
recovery. Government spending was absorbed into savings and speculation—
as well as used to purchase imports—neutralizing its expansionary
effects.footnote^88 <#note-88> When stimulus flows into balance-sheet
adjustments rather than productive activity, growth remains sluggish and
underutilization persists. Meanwhile, the uneven distribution of
stimulus effects can deepen inequality: firms with pricing power raise
prices and distribute profits to shareholders, while inflation erodes
the real incomes of low-wage households—as happened in the us following
the $7 trillion 2020–21 stimulus in response to the Covid
pandemic.footnote^89 <#note-89> This tension between the ‘real
resources’ logic of functional finance and the financial logic of
private actors helps explain why capitalist economies, even when
aggressively stimulated, often struggle to reach full utilization. It
also suggests a compelling reason to privilege direct public investment
over other forms of stimulus, on the grounds that it directly mobilizes
idle resources, limiting leakage into financial accumulation.

Beyond these macro-financial frictions lies a deeper political problem.
Even when the technical conditions for stimulus exist, its deployment at
a level adequate both to generate and maintain stability and foster
economic dynamism depends on the state’s willingness to confront the
entrenched structural power of capital. Governments must be prepared to
face bond markets without fear, force central banks to monetize debt,
impose capital controls to prevent capital flight, and manage trade to
reduce fiscal constraints. More fundamentally, if functional finance is
going to be used to restructure the economy around social and ecological
ends, states must be willing to ratchet up public investment while
establishing control over private investment decisions—all of which will
alienate powerful investors and lead to efforts at economic sabotage.
Functional finance may describe how the system works in theory, but in
practice it has only been embraced in moments of systemic crisis—when it
is seen as saving capitalism, not challenging it.footnote^90 <#note-90>


      11. the national investment board

Yet even if Keynes underestimated the political opposition his programme
would encounter, what matters for our purposes is that he saw how it
could be implemented. His confidence in the profound restructuring he
proposed rested on his diagnosis of mature capitalist economies’ chronic
tendency towards stagnation: as markets became saturated and the pace of
technological innovation slowed, profitability and investment rates
would decline, leaving productive resources persistently underutilized.
In this situation, traditional levers of macroeconomic policy—lower
interest rates, tax cuts or periodic fiscal stimulus—would no longer
suffice to reinvigorate private investment. Instead, a structural
transformation was necessary: public investment would need to assume the
coordinating role once played by private capital. Keynes believed that
the social and political tensions generated by prolonged stagnation
would eventually force society to pursue new foundations for stability
and prosperity through the socialization of investment.

The institutional mechanism Keynes proposed for this was the National
Investment Board. He first raised the idea in 1928 and returned to it
repeatedly throughout the 1930s and 40s.footnote^91 <#note-91> Conceived
as a public authority tasked with directing long-term economic
development, the Board’s primary mission would be to maintain full
employment through sustained public investment. Though accountable to
Parliament, the Board would be staffed by technical experts with
independent authority to approve or deny major private investment
projects.footnote^92 <#note-92> Crucially, its decisions would be guided
by the availability of real resources—labour, productive capacity,
natural resources—rather than financial constraints. Freed from the
obligation to generate financial returns, the Board could pursue full
resource utilization as a goal in its own right. Over time, by
consistently prioritizing these broader collective aims, the National
Investment Board would gradually displace private accumulation as the
central engine of economic activity. As one public-investment project
after another broke ground, the economy—like a car previously stalled—
would lurch forward and then gather momentum. At that point, the
economic machinery would be moving again; the only remaining question
would be the direction in which to go.

For Keynes, the answer to this question seemed clear. He did not believe
that capitalism, even in its mature form, had met everyone’s needs. On
the contrary, because private investment was narrowly guided by the
search for financial returns, it would build houses and factories and
churn out consumer goods and services only when doing so promised an
adequate profit. This satisfied many material needs, but it left
countless others unmet, particularly in areas where profitability was
uncertain or low. More troubling, the logic of private investment
systematically ignored whole categories of need which could not easily
be priced: aesthetic quality, cultural depth, emotional well-being,
social connection—the bases for living ‘wisely, agreeably and well’.
Public investment, Keynes argued, could reshape the economy around a
richer conception of the good. He asked why, in an advanced society, we
should not ‘add to every substantial city of the realm the dignity of an
ancient university or a European capital’:

    Enhancing our local schools and their surroundings, our local
    government and its offices, and—perhaps above all—providing a local
    centre of refreshment and entertainment, complete with an ample
    theatre, a concert hall, a dance hall, a gallery, a British
    restaurant, canteens, cafés and so forth.footnote^93 <#note-93>

This was what it meant, to Keynes, to build a ‘New Jerusalem’. He
estimated it would take a few decades to get there.

These ideas were fleshed out by William Beveridge in two wartime reports
for the British government: /Social Insurance and Allied Service/ (1942)
and /Full Employment in a Free Society/ (1944), written with the
assistance of the political economist Nicholas Kaldor. The 1944 report
outlined a comprehensive programme for eradicating what Beveridge called
the ‘five great evils’—ignorance, squalor, disease, poverty and
idleness. Central to its project was a sustained commitment to large-
scale public investment, directed by a National Investment Board. In
fact, Beveridge anticipated that only 25 per cent of total national
investment would remain in private manufacturing industry, and even this
share would fall under the ‘direct control’ of the Board, since the
latter would have the ‘power to stop or reduce by order a proposed
private investment plan’. This closely aligns with the proposals Keynes
was making in his wartime letters—albeit now given a more explicit
policy edge.

This prioritization of public investment would ensure that it was not
merely ‘a gap-filling device to take up the slack of private outlay’, an
approach Keynes himself had dismissed as clumsy and ineffective.
Instead, public investment would be mobilized deliberately and directly
for its own sake. By harnessing society’s resources to deliver what
today might be termed universal basic services, Beveridge sought to
build widespread popular support for a transition from profit-led
accumulation to an economy driven by public investment. Each of his
first four evils would be directly confronted through targeted
investments—universal education, mass public housing, universal
healthcare and income security through an expanded welfare state—on a
scale large enough to eliminate the fifth evil, idleness, by maintaining
permanent full employment.footnote^94 <#note-94> A welcome side effect
of pursuing these aims would be the stabilization of the economy and the
effective end of recessions.

Beveridge and Kaldor envisaged this transformation as a three-phase
process. In the initial ‘transition’ phase, unfolding through 1945–47,
the economy would shift from wartime measures to peace. During the
second phase, ‘reconstruction’, public investment would be dramatically
expanded to build the physical and social infrastructure necessary for a
flourishing society, with high investment continuing until society’s
needs were fully met. Beveridge and Kaldor suggested this phase would
take twenty years, meaning that from 1968(!) the economy would begin to
enter its third and final phase, in which investment levels would
gradually decline and the focus would shift to expanding consumption.
High taxes on income would ensure that consumption rights were broadly
shared across the population. Working hours would be systematically
reduced, too, allowing individuals more time for leisure and cultural
pursuits.footnote^95 <#note-95>

At this point, the result would seem to resemble the socialist vision of
a post-capitalist society, in which material security is guaranteed,
free time is abundant and the profit motive has been eliminated. But the
path to this world is different. Rather than socializing all production,
the Keynes–Beveridge–Kaldor project required only a socialization of
investment. Market exchange would persist, but it would take place in an
economy where both interest rates and profit rates had been pushed to
zero. Firms would still exist, too, but they would no longer generate
profits; the only income available would be labour income, paying
managers’ and workers’ salaries, rather than generating returns for
investors. (Here Keynes and Beveridge were less radical than Mill, who
argued that at the point where profit ceases to motivate investment, all
enterprises would transition to worker self-management.) While Beveridge
stressed the persistence of liberal freedoms, including freedoms of
speech, association, occupational choice and market exchange, he pointed
out that the list of essential liberties ‘does not include liberty of a
private citizen, to own means of production and to employ other citizens
in operating them at a wage’.footnote^96 <#note-96> By Keynes’s
definition, this would still be capitalism—since, for him, capitalism
was any system structured around monetary incentives—but capitalists
themselves would cease to exist.footnote^97 <#note-97> The state, having
taken responsibility for the investment function, would continue to
allocate resources based on non-monetary goals.


      12. structural flaws

The project of social transformation outlined by the Keynesians was
bold, but its political foundations were weak. This helps to explain why
the programme was never really implemented after the Second World War.
The radical Keynesians failed to reckon with the dominant social forces
whose interests it would jeopardize—or the working-class support it
might attract. They thought that investment and employment policies
could be designed by experts like themselves as neutral, technical
responses to the problem of economic coordination. Unlike Marxists, who
understood the capitalist economy as a site of political conflict
between capital and labour, early Keynesians treated wages as if set by
marginal productivity and saw investment as a technical input rather
than a site of strategic contestation. From this perspective, achieving
full resource utilization appeared not as a shift in power, but as a
universal good. In failing to recognize the class nature of the economy
they sought to reform, Keynesians misunderstood both the resistance
their programme would provoke and the basis of support it would need to
succeed.

Nowhere is this clearer than in their discussions of full employment.
Keynes’s programme aimed to sustain permanently high levels of
investment in order to prevent mass unemployment. But unemployment is
not just a byproduct of economic cycles—it is a mechanism of class
discipline. When labour markets tighten, wages rise. Capitalists may
tolerate this so long as productivity keeps pace. But under Keynes’s
programme, public investment would push beyond that point—removing
capitalists’ ability to reduce the demand for labour. Recall Keynes’s
suggestion that, by continuing to invest far past the point at which a
recession would typically be triggered, society could achieve a
‘euthanasia of the rentier’ over the course of just a few decades. As
Michał Kalecki pointed out, the capitalists would not go quietly. They
would resist incorporation into an economic system they no longer
controlled—and would oppose, with all of their considerable power, any
institution that threatened their capacity to provoke a recession
through disinvestment. A National Investment Board, for precisely that
reason, would become a central target.footnote^98 <#note-98>

But the problem was not just capitalist resistance. Workers might also
see full employment as a starting point from which to leverage for
further demands. Greater job security would give them the confidence to
push for higher wages and for changes in how production is organized.
Rather than organizing labour as a political force capable of defending
and shaping public investment, Keynesians tried to contain it.
Beveridge, for example, argued that unions would need to discipline
their members in order to make full employment compatible with economic
stability.footnote^99 <#note-99> But in seeking to limit labour’s role,
Keynesians would demobilize the very people whose support they needed.
Instead of building a political base, they sought to manage it away.

The Keynesian commitment to political ‘neutrality’ extended to their
model of public investment. They assumed that the state would steer
economic development towards socially beneficial goals without
fundamentally altering how firms or workers operate. Unlike the More-to-
Marx socialists, who imagined a world in which all would act in the
interests of each, Keynesians assigned the task of acting in the general
interest to the state, while leaving everyone else to pursue monetary
rewards. Even at the limit of full investment—when profits and interest
rates have fallen to zero—firms would remain efficiency-first
organizations, because workers and managers would continue to be driven
by performance-based financial incentives. This framework placed an
impossible burden on the state. It assumed that a single institution
could correct for the failures of an economy still structured around the
pursuit of financial gain, rather than transforming those structures so
that firms and workers become multi-criterial actors in their own right.

This leads to the programme’s first structural failure: excessive
centralization. Like all models of central planning, Keynesianism faces
the classic knowledge problem: the state lacks the local, sector-
specific knowledge necessary to make effective investment decisions
across the entire economy. Keynesians often attempt to compensate for
this by invoking ‘state capacity’—relying on experts, models and long-
term planning.footnote^100 <#note-100> But much of the relevant
knowledge is embedded in the lived practices of firms and industries,
and cannot be fully captured or transmitted to a central authority. Even
with the best expertise, a centralized investment board would struggle
to allocate resources effectively across the economy.footnote^101
<#note-101>

The model’s second structural failure was the assumption that the state
could overcome the problem of uncertainty through scale and
coordination. Keynes rightly saw uncertainty as a central problem of
capitalism: private investment slows when the future is unclear. He
thought the state could step into this void, boldly investing where
private firms hesitated, smoothing out risk and creating the conditions
for stability. But acting in spite of uncertainty does not resolve the
problem of uncertainty itself. Large-scale projects require long lead
times, and even with good information, planners make mistakes. As
Schumpeter noted in /Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy/, they can back
the wrong technology, build in the wrong places, misread long-term
demand.footnote^102 <#note-102> Keynes thought that because the state
does not face profit constraints, it could absorb these errors over
time. But without clear mechanisms for feedback or revision, mistakes
can accumulate. Planners may double down on failed projects rather than
change course, as they did in the Soviet Bloc, undermining the
legitimacy of public investment and sapping confidence in the
institutions that direct it.

The third structural failure was Keynes’s treatment of investment as a
technical rather than a politically contestable process. Like Mill
before him, Keynes was a multi-criterial thinker who recognized that
economic life should be guided by values beyond profit. But he assumed
that these could simply be added into the calculus of the planner. He
did not reckon with the conflicts that adding those goals necessarily
generates. Pursuing ecological sustainability may come at the cost of
living standards or food production; prioritizing care may reduce
efficiency gains. All investment decisions require trade-offs—and these
are no mere technical matter. They are political judgements about the
kind of society we want to build. Keynes assumed that these questions
could be resolved through the application of technical expertise. But
history shows that expert planning, even with good intentions, can
produce deeply unjust outcomes when it overrides democratic
participation. The real challenge is to democratize the procedure by
which goals are set, trade-offs are negotiated and futures are chosen.

The Keynesian framework did allow for investment priorities to be
debated and set by Parliament, which also appointed the leaders of the
investment board. But the public’s role was limited to electing
parliamentary representatives who might, at best, adjust the guidance
given to technocratic planners. There was no institutional mechanism by
which workers, communities or social movements could shape the way
public goods were defined and targeted—or contest the trade-offs
embedded in the state’s investment decisions. For a time, this omission
could be masked by economic gains. But as demands deepened, and as the
political stakes of investment became more visible, the legitimacy of a
system without voice would begin to erode. This contradiction played out
even under the limited Keynesianization of Britain in the postwar period.

Though aspects of the welfare state were implemented by the Attlee
government (National Insurance, nhs), Keynesians never succeeded in
using public investment to transform long-term economic development.
But, here and elsewhere, they did get states to adopt policies aimed at
achieving high employment. For a time, this Keynesian compromise worked:
employment remained high, wages rose and living standards improved.
Unions restrained workers’ demands, maintaining stability rather than
pushing for systemic change. However, the mismatch between workers’
growing power and their inability to use it ultimately led to
disillusionment and disengagement. By the late 1960s, the cracks in this
arrangement became impossible to ignore. Workers, students and
marginalized groups demanded not only better living conditions but also
a greater say in how society was run. This explosion of demands
overwhelmed that era’s technocratic systems of management. The outcome
was a period of intensifying class struggle through the 1970s and 80s,
in which Thatcher’s government spearheaded the interests of the
capitalist class and won a set of far-reaching victories.

Yet Keynes’s discovery was of profound importance for proponents of a
post-capitalist order. The modern state already invests for non-
pecuniary reasons. Its projects do not need to generate profits. They
are undertaken for a public purpose: to provide housing, education,
healthcare and so on, for their own sake. They exemplify an entirely
different investment logic, in which resource allocation is guided by
social priorities rather than financial return. Grappling with the
chronic joblessness of the interwar period, Keynes’s insight that full
employment could be one such priority was the original impetus behind
his call for the socialization of investment. Once he saw that public
investment could become the economy’s coordinating force, its role
expanded dramatically in his thinking: not merely a stabilizing tool,
but a vehicle for social transformation. By severing the links between
investment and future profitability, on the one hand, and prior savings,
on the other, Keynes suggested a powerful institutional tool for a post-
capitalist economy—a potentially multi-criterial public-investment
function.footnote^103 <#note-103>


      13. lessons for a multi-criterial future

What conclusions should be drawn from this long history? First, the
struggle for an economic order governed by broader values than the
profit drive alone, so tirelessly reimagined from More to Cabet to
Morris, can only succeed if it grasps the full complexity of
contemporary capitalist societies. The mature Marx devoted himself to
that problem but—the second lesson—failed to give sufficient attention
to the problems of the post-capitalist transition, especially regarding
investment. Grappling with these, in conditions of isolation,
backwardness and permanent external threat, Soviet planners invented the
command-economy model of modern industrial development, whose
extraordinary advances in productive capacity came at the price—a third
lesson—of negating local variations, ground-level knowledge and the
importance of flexibility and autonomy in day-to-day activity, where the
market might play the role of servant, not of master.

Fourth, as Neurath saw, the centralized plan under a hierarchical party
structure could never adequately meet ‘the wish for co-existence of
different forms of life and organization’. That would require democratic
adjudication, therefore also—a fifth lesson—new forms of economic
education, which Neurath attempted with his isotype project and his work
at the Society and Economy Museum in Red Vienna. Sixth, as Keynes
understood, socialized investment requires an institutional architecture
if it is to reshape economic production to meet these multiple needs.
But—the seventh lesson—that architecture needs to be far more legible,
responsive and decentralized than a Beveridge-era nib; and to rest upon
a computational-communicative digital-data matrix of a scale that not
even Neurath could have imagined. Finally, it will need to support a
radical reconfiguration of productive relations at the enterprise level
and a reinvention of the character of money itself, to separate its
investment, exchange and consumption functions.

To build such a system, we must first clarify the logic on which it
rests—the theory of values that can serve as a foundation for a twenty-
first-century socialism. In capitalism, as we have seen, firms operate
under a regime of single-criterion optimization: they are structured to
maximize profit. Every production possibility they face can be ranked on
that single scale. Two investments that yield the same risk-adjusted
rate of return are, within this framework, exactly equivalent in value—
regardless of their social, ecological or moral consequences. This logic
radically simplifies decision-making. Profit becomes the overriding
measure of worth; every other consideration is treated as either a means
to that end or a constraint to be managed. It is this structure that
allows capitalism to function with a clear and impersonal coherence. In
state-socialist systems, the objective shifted from profit to physical
output growth, but the model remained one of constrained optimization.
Planners sought to maximize total production from available inputs,
measuring success in tons of coal or kilowatt-hours of electricity. As
in capitalism, every decision was evaluated according to its
contribution to this singular aim. Other goals—like ecological balance
or work quality—as well as the people who advocated for them, were often
suppressed. In both systems, economic coordination was built not to
navigate among competing values, but to maximize a single one.

A multi-criterial approach demands a fundamental shift in how economic
decisions are made. This is not a matter of ideology or psychology; it
is a matter of logic. A system organized around multiple ends would
treat goals such as economic security, sustainability, autonomy, beauty
and social connection not as constraints or instruments, but as
intrinsically worthwhile. These goals are incommensurable: they cannot
be measured in terms of a common unit. They are also non-compensatory:
gains in one domain cannot fully offset losses in another. A better
society would pursue each of these aims directly—unlocking a vast
reservoir of practical knowledge currently locked up in corporations and
directed towards profitability.footnote^104 <#note-104> Workers and
engineers, freed from the imperatives of financial return, could
redesign production processes to support long-term ecological
regeneration, improve the quality and meaning of work and develop
infrastructures that sustain care and connection. Coordination would no
longer mean maximizing one value at the expense of others but learning
how to advance many goals—social and ecological—in parallel.

Yet the pursuit of multiple goals does not eliminate the problem that
our resources are limited. Even with enormous productive capacity, we
operate within a finite resource base. Trade-offs are therefore
inevitable. Some values must be partially sacrificed to support others,
and because the losses are not fully compensable, there is no optimal
solution in the usual sense. Instead, decision-making must be understood
as a process of composition: selecting particular ways of integrating
multiple goals, where each composition reflects a different way of
handling unavoidable trade-offs across intrinsically worthwhile aims. My
contribution is to treat the resolution of this composition problem as
the central task of economic coordination. By contrast to systems that
prioritize a single goal and assume the rest will follow, a multi-
criterial economy pursues multiple goals directly, in a way that
requires choosing among futures that are constrained and, in many cases,
mutually exclusive. A society built around dense cities and shared
infrastructure looks very different from one built around decentralized
eco-villages. An economy organized around widespread automation and
minimal work leads to a different kind of life than one built around
skill, craft and human involvement in production. These are not simply
variations in emphasis; they are distinct ways of composing our aims
into a liveable whole. In a world of constraints and incompatibilities,
we cannot pursue all values at once or in their fullest form. We can,
however, pursue them in particular arrangements, where each goal remains
present in a specific balance with others.

This structure can be formalized as a problem of multi-criterial
optimization, but one of a particular type. As we saw in our discussion
of Neurath’s intervention into the planning debates, we must begin not
with fixed value rankings, but with the recognition of value
uncertainty: we care about many things, and their relative importance is
indeterminate for us, as individuals and societies. Value uncertainty is
further complexified by factual uncertainty. We rarely know in advance
which effects will follow from which choices or what unintended
consequences may emerge over time. Still, even without ranked
preferences or weighted functions, many possible ways of organizing
economic activity can be ruled out because they are clearly worse across
all the dimensions. These are what are known as ‘dominated’ options.
What remains is a non-dominated set: a field of alternatives, each
representing a different way of balancing plural, non-compensatory
goals.footnote^105 <#note-105> No single objective function can sort
them: they can be compared but not commensurated.

This is where the limits of technical reasoning become clear.
Determination of the optimal solution set is a problem for technical
reasoning to solve, but choice among the options in that set is not,
since from a technical perspective, these options are equivalent in
rank, no matter how different they are in content. Hopes that advances
in computational power might overcome any need for social and ecological
choice—making it possible to digitally plan the economy—fundamentally
mischaracterize the problem, once we recognize the existence of
multiple, non-compensatory social goals. The challenge is not simply
processing more data. It is deciding what matters—negotiating trade-offs
and choosing among possible futures. Reason, experience and collective
deliberation will inform these choices but never entirely resolve them.

What enables such a society to move forward is not consensus on facts or
values, but agreement on legitimate selection procedures. This much
Neurath himself understood in the 1920s. Yet given the technical and
value complexity of contemporary economies, we need to imagine these
procedures rather differently than he did. Neurath assumed that
navigating among competing futures required a choice between aggregated,
centralized plans. The framework I propose generalizes the problem of
plural goals and finite resources, making it possible to stage multi-
criterial decisions at every level of the economy—from households and
firms to associations and investment bodies—each drawing on forms of
local knowledge specific to their domain. These decisions can be
understood as instances of structured multi-criterial choice under the
condition of a budget constraint. The constraint defines a bounded space
of feasible action, internalizing the reality that not all values can be
pursued in full. But it also structures the decision process itself,
ensuring that competing aims be weighed and concrete priorities set.

Budget constraints play a crucial role in this framework because they
separate what can be priced from what must be judged. The economic costs
of pursuing any given course of action—measured in terms of labour,
materials and time—can be priced; therefore they can also be added up
and compared in terms of a single commensurable unit. But the benefits
any economic course of action is meant to achieve—greater efficiency,
restored ecosystems, improved working conditions—as well as its non-
economic costs, cannot be reduced to a single metric. These must be
evaluated in kind, according to the irreducible values they represent.
This approach makes cost-benefit analysis, in the conventional sense,
inapplicable. Yet it does not eliminate the need for technical
reasoning. Across all domains of economic life, many options can still
be ruled out as clearly ‘dominated’: they require more and deliver less.
Among the remaining non-dominated options, however, no technical formula
can determine which to prioritize. What remains are multiple spaces of
value composition: of choosing how to balance among competing goods
within a fixed resource envelope.

Because this framework is based on structured procedures for choosing
among viable alternatives, it does not require prior agreement on how
many values there are, or how they should be defined, measured or
prioritized. Values shape economic outcomes dynamically, through the
decisions people make—under conditions of uncertainty and within the
constraints of a shared budget. By contrast, other efforts to embed
multidimensionality into economic coordination—such as Amartya Sen and
Martha Nussbaum’s capability approach, the oecd’s wellbeing dashboards
or the un’s Sustainable Development Goals—depend on a limited,
predefined set of values and metrics.footnote^106 <#note-106> That is
because they lack a decision-making procedure capable of navigating
ongoing value disagreement. In the absence of such a procedure, they
must fix the relevant goals in advance—agreeing on what counts, and how
much, before action can be taken. The system described here makes no
such demand.

It is based on multi-criterial optimization in conditions of uncertainty
—about both facts and values—but allows values to emerge through the
decision-making process itself. For this reason, it is fully /n/-
dimensional: capable of accommodating any number of evolving, contested
and newly imagined goals. People may support the same option for
different reasons or revise their views over time in response to
experience and debate. Values are not fixed inputs to the system. They
enter into argument, take shape through selection and are redefined by
the accumulation of decisions. What a society values, in this model, is
not declared in advance; it is discovered in practice.

To make reasoned deliberation and choice possible, however, a multi-
criterial society would need a detailed statistical infrastructure—joy
through statistics, to borrow Keynes’s phrase—capable of representing
many different social and ecological conditions and outcomes in kind,
rather than in monetary terms. As Neurath foresaw, this apparatus would
have to include social, ecological and emotional indicators alongside
economic ones: carbon absorption, biodiversity loss, job satisfaction,
heat exposure, hours of unpaid care, rates of loneliness. These data
must be presented in forms people can interpret and use—statistical,
visual and narrative. Their purpose is not to dictate what matters, but
to help people see what is at stake from a variety of perspectives.

As noted, the logic of structured multi-criterial choice described here
can be applied at every level of the economy—each shaped by its own
goals, forms of knowledge and resource constraints. Households face a
consumption budget—beyond what is already guaranteed through universal
basic services—and must decide how to allocate time, attention and
resources across plural, non-compensatory aims. These may include
economic security, autonomy, usefulness, rest, connection, respect.
Rather than being substitutable, such values are held in tension;
coordinating them requires ongoing judgement. Firms, likewise, operate
within a production budget. As non-profit, public institutions, they are
evaluated on their ability to balance multiple goals, like efficiency,
sustainability, resilience, work quality, social justice and internal
democracy. These trade-offs cannot be resolved by prices or algorithms
alone. They require deliberation within and across work units, supported
by accountability structures that reflect evolving standards of
performance. Investment, finally, becomes the site where society makes
decisions about its long-term direction. Investment bodies receive a
fixed share of collective resources, issued not through private savings
or taxation but via public monetary creation—an application of
functional finance. These resources are not allocated to maximize
financial return, but to advance shared priorities: for example,
greening production, expanding care, deepening access, redressing past
harms. Some proposals are ruled out as incoherent or ‘dominated’; others
are selected through structured political procedures that weigh
competing values within a collectively defined budget. In each case,
coordination proceeds through composition—holding multiple aims
together, within constraints, to determine what can be pursued, and in
what form.

A multi-criterial economy offers a framework for making difficult
choices. Its promise lies not in producing optimal outcomes, but in
allowing people to consider viable futures, weigh what matters and
decide together how to move forward. Across every level of the economy,
this means accepting that value trade-offs are real and that they cannot
be outsourced to markets, planners or machines. In our societies, as in
our lives, things get better by confronting the choices we have to make,
not evading them—by learning how to compose a strategy from values that
pull us in different directions. Progress, in this framework, becomes
open-ended: not the maximization of one goal, but the ongoing capacity
to bring to light competing possibilities and select among them. At the
social level, that process will always be conflictual—and hence
political. But it is through this politics that fuller lives become
possible. Such is the logic of multi-criterial economics that underlies
the institutional design to be elaborated in Part Two.

alternative decisions on a rational basis, on different scales of value,

into Bebel’s understanding of democratized production as purely
technical debate. By contrast Alexander Bogdanov’s /Red Star/,
Bloomington in 1984 [1908], in which Martian scientists argue over
whether to invade Earth or Venus in response to resource depletion on
their own planet, represents a rare moment of real political argument in
a socialist utopia, though notably, the debate remains confined to experts.

18 <#reference-18> China’s domestic monetary system under Mao reflected
a similar logic of separation to that of the ussr. Chinese enterprises
operated within a cashless accounting system, transacting through bank-
mediated transfers approved by the People’s Bank of China, while
households received wages and made purchases in cash renminbi. Firms
could not access cash directly, and all inter-enterprise payments
required plan authorization. In the 1980s, as reforms advanced, a dual-
track pricing system emerged, allowing goods to circulate at both plan
prices and market prices, effectively creating parallel circuits within
a single currency. These arrangements preserved planning authority while
managing scarcity and enabling marginal liberalization, allowing a very
different outcome to that of the ussr. See Barry Naughton, /The Chinese

26 <#reference-26> In focusing narrowly on how value is determined under
capitalism, value-form theory goes astray. It cannot fulfil the promise
implicit in the project that Marx and Engels set out to achieve: the
development of a framework that not only explains capitalist exchange
but also gestures towards the outlines of a post-capitalist economy—one
that lacks a single standard of value yet retains coherence. See the
chapter on distribution in Engels’s /Anti-Dühring/, likely written at
least in part by, or in collaboration with, Marx. For representative
accounts of value-form theory, see Hans-Georg Backhaus, ‘Zur Dialektik

Polanyi develops this thread in /The Great Transformation/, New York 1944.
30 <#reference-30> Within Marxism, this view seems to arise most
directly from Engels, who held that the purpose of the state is to
repress and exclude. It therefore follows that, ‘as soon as there is no
longer any social class to be held in subjection’ and hence ‘class rule’
ends, ‘nothing more remains to be repressed, and a special repressive
force, a state, is no longer necessary’: Engels, /Anti-Dühring/, p. 340.
31 <#reference-31> Non-Marxist socialists have also developed accounts
of the epistemic value of democracy. See, for example, W. E. B. Du
Bois, /Darkwater/, New York 1920, and John Dewey, /The Public and Its
Problems/, New York 1927, which both argue that society achieves greater
clarity through the inclusion of previously excluded voices and can
chart a more just and democratic path forward on that basis.

37 <#reference-37> Even Pat Devine’s /Democracy and Economic Planning/,
whose concept of ‘negotiated coordination’ is crucial to the model I
will go on to develop in Part Two, adheres to a largely additive theory
of value, assuming that participants in a socialist economy will,
through deliberation, tend towards compromise and consensus. There is
space for political conflict only when negotiation breaks down—and with
it, the ability to coordinate production in the affected sectors.
Economic activity cannot resume until the conflict is resolved and
negotiated coordination is re-established. This interruption is
understood to generate the social pressure necessary to restore compromise.

40 <#reference-40> In 1920, Neurath would reflect on the defeat of the
Bavarian Soviet Republic: ‘Civil war is raging in Germany. Famine,
Disease and Murder are at work, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. How
could they be resisted? Only by our will and knowledge. This misery has
befallen us not least because we lacked clear aims. Marxists killed
playful utopianism, thus saving the unity of the Party and “scientific
rigour”, but also paralysing the resolve to think up new forms. The
doctrine of historical necessity became quietism for many; what Marx
said about active engagement in reconstruction was forgotten . . . The
proletariat and their allies found themselves with much power in the
November Revolution. What was lacking, however, was an idea of the
economic future that could have guided the will’: ‘A System of
Socialization’, in Thomas Uebel and Robert Cohen, eds, /Economic

44 <#reference-44> Otto Neurath, ‘Utopia as a Social Engineer’s
Construction’ [1919], in /Empiricism and Sociology/. In his earlier
work, Neurath framed uncertainty as an epistemic problem: we lack the
knowledge or techniques to measure or aggregate competing values, as in
his critique of the ‘pleasure maximum’. In later writings, however, he
appears to move towards an ontological view—that values may be
irreducibly plural, or that what we call ‘happiness’ is not a single
object, but rather a plurality of objects lacking a common unit. For
Neurath, this insight applied equally to individual and social life.
Economists have tried to evade the problem by converting uncertainty
into calculable risk, assigning probabilities to unknown futures. But,
like Neurath, Frank Knight (/Risk, Uncertainty and Profit/, Boston 1921)
and Keynes (/The General Theory/, Chap. 12) recognized that true
uncertainty resists such reduction.

56 <#reference-56> In 1936, Lange already noted that once profit-
maximizing resistance was removed, externalities such as pollution could
be priced directly into socialist markets.
57 <#reference-57> The issue may have been that Neurath did not fully
recognize the degree of systematicity required to enact even incremental
changes within a multi-dimensional planning framework. He did attempt to
flesh out the institutional side of this vision in ‘International
Planning for Freedom’, /Economic Writings/, but in a way that was less
coherent than his earlier work on total socialization. On the
possibility of a Neurathian ‘mixed economy’ with both market and in-kind
dimensions, see Thomas Uebel, ‘Calculation in Kind and Substantive
Rationality’. The model that will be developed in Part Two of this study
can be understood as a variant of this approach.
58 <#reference-58> See Robert Allen, /Farm to Factory: A
Reinterpretation of the Soviet Industrial Revolution/, Princeton 2003.
Allen argues that the ussr’s rapid growth was due not only to state-led
investment planning, but also to demographic change. Revolutionary
upheaval helped jump-start the fertility transition; mass education—
particularly among women—accelerated it. That lowered population growth,
thereby boosting per capita income. See also Alec Nove, /An Economic
History of the / ussr /, 1917–1992/, London 1993.
59 <#reference-59> Allen, /Farm to Factory/. Allen argues that the
ussr’s economic stagnation beginning in the mid-1960s was partly the
result of poor investment decisions. Enormous resources were directed
towards searching for new energy sources that delivered little, and
towards retrofitting old plants rather than building newer, larger and
more efficient ones. These choices significantly reduced the
effectiveness of investment in raising gdp levels.

61 <#reference-61> Guild Socialist accounts by G. D. H. Cole and others
typically neglected the stagnation of guild-run systems, particularly
their resistance to technical innovation, low rates of investment and
limited capacity to adjust supply in response to demand. Instead, Guild
Socialists held up pre-capitalist markets as models of ethical
coordination, celebrating the ‘just price’ as affording workers a
measure of dignity and supporting craftsmanship in production. Karl
Polanyi echoed this idea in /The Great Transformation/, and E. P.
Thompson gave it historical depth in /Customs in Common: Studies in
Traditional Popular Culture/, New York 1991. See also Cole, /Guild

64 <#reference-64> Roemer’s proposal reflected a broader shift in left
theory in the 1990s, in which socialism was increasingly framed in
Rawlsian terms: not as the democratization and transformation of
production, but as the fair distribution of its outcomes. See also G. A.

66 <#reference-66> ‘Let me remind the reader here that I was the first
to use the categories “variable capital” and “constant capital”.
Political economy since the time of Adam Smith has confusedly mixed up
the determining characteristics contained in these categories with the
merely formal distinction, arising out of the process of circulation,
between fixed and circulating capital’: Marx/, Capital: Vol. I/, p. 760.
See also, p. 783, footnote 13.
67 <#reference-67> Marx’s critique of thinkers like Proudhon, John
Francis Bray and Robert Grey led him to conclude as early as the 1840s
that any attempt to reform capital allocation without abolishing
commodity production entirely was incoherent. See Karl Marx, /The
Poverty of Philosophy/ [1847] in /Marx and Engels Collected Works, Vol.
6/, London 1976.
68 <#reference-68> This insight was partially realized in the most
effective episodes of state-led development, including those in Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, which adapted the Soviet model by
combining targeted public investment with competitive market operations
at the firm level. China later followed a similar path. It was not
planning itself but the attempt to plan everything that was the problem.
See Chalmers Johnson, miti /and the Japanese Miracle/, Stanford 1982;
Alice Amsden, /Asia’s Next Giant: South Korea and Late
Industrialization/, Oxford 1989; and Robert Wade, /Governing the
Market/, Princeton 1990. See also Isabella Weber, /How China Escaped
Shock Therapy: The Market Reform Debate/, London 2021. None of these
Asian models, however, attempted to democratize investment planning or
open it to plural goals.
69 <#reference-69> In ‘International Planning for Freedom’, Neurath
proposed regional planning as a way to avoid the complexity of national
economic coordination. But this solution invites criticism from both
directions: it lacks a mechanism for aggregating across regions, and at
the same time, remains too aggregated to be implemented effectively at
the local level: /Empiricism and Sociology/, pp. 422–40.
70 <#reference-70> This oversight was criticized both by Austrians in
the Socialist Calculation Debate and later by Keynesians, who emphasized
investment’s role in coordinating expectations and managing uncertainty.

of Employment: The Draft Note for the Chancellor of the Exchequer’, 10
June 1943, in the same volume. In 1943, the English economist James
Meade proposed a set of demand stabilizers to lessen the severity of
recessions—the sort of mechanism that would later bear the name
Keynesianism. Keynes rejected this approach outright: ‘I think you lay
too much stress on cure and too little on prevention. It is quite true
that a fluctuating volume of public works at short notice is a clumsy
form of cure . . . On the other hand, if the bulk of investment is under
public or semi-public control and we go in for a stable long-term
programme, serious fluctuations are enormously less likely to occur’:
‘Letter to J. E. Meade’, 27 May 1943, p. 326.
74 <#reference-74> When Keynes referred to ‘semi-public’ investment, he
had in mind the large corporations that were so systemically important
that they operated, in effect, as public utilities. Unless the state
could control their investment decisions, public investment would have
to fluctuate wildly in response to private plans—an eventuality Keynes
explicitly recognized as ‘clumsy’ and unworkable. See also Crotty, /
Keynes against Capitalism/, which supports this argument with more
textual evidence.

Problem of Full Employment’, p. 324.
76 <#reference-76> Keynes refers to this situation as one of ‘full
investment’, in the sense that ‘an aggregate gross yield in excess of
replacement cost could no longer be expected on a reasonable calculation
from a further increment of durable goods of any type whatever’: /The
General Theory/,//p. 324.

78 <#reference-78> Keynes, ‘Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren’
[1930], in /Essays in Persuasion/, London 1931, pp. 373, 367. Keynes
assumed that the transition to a life in which ‘we shall once more value
ends above means and prefer the good to the useful’ would be non-
conflictual, the only problem being an individual one of figuring out
how to occupy one’s time.

within Mill’s modified utilitarianism: progress, security, liberty,
equality, fraternity. See also Kirsten Madden and Joseph Persky, /

Robert Owen, William Thompson, J. S. Mill and G. D. H. Cole.
80 <#reference-80> Although Keynes assumes in /The General Theory/,
Chap. 2, that wages correspond to the marginal productivity of labour
under full employment, this has been rejected by many post-Keynesians,
particularly those in the tradition of Luigi Pasinetti and Joan
Robinson, who argue that income distribution is shaped by institutional
and political forces. See Pasinetti, /Growth and Income Distribution:

81 <#reference-81> On the political obstacles to full employment, see
Michał Kalecki, ‘Political Aspects of Full Employment’, /Political
Quarterly/, vol. 14, no. 4, October 1943. Kalecki argued that
capitalists would oppose permanent full employment not because it was
economically unfeasible, but because it would reduce their power to
discipline labour and weaken the social position of business leaders.

Decline/, London 2024, which argues that functional finance is best
understood as a strategy for stabilizing capitalism, not a challenge to
its underlying structure.
91 <#reference-91> Keynes initially proposed the idea of a National
Investment Board to the Liberal Industrial Inquiry in /Britain’s
Industrial Future/, London 1928; see Crotty, /Keynes against
Capitalism/, Chap. 8. For a contemporary version of a similar
institutional arrangement, see Saule Omarova /et al./, ‘The National
Investment Authority: An Institutional Blueprint’, Berggruen Institute,
2022.
92 <#reference-92> According to Crotty, Keynes ‘believed that the
institutions that will design and implement the details of economic
planning must be free of political interference in their day-to-day
operations. These should be the exclusive province of experts and
technicians. But the general objectives and relative priorities of
planning are to be under democratic political control, the sole province
of the elected authorities’: /Keynes against Capitalism/, Chap. 8.
Although Crotty uses the terms ‘liberal socialism’ and ‘democratic
socialism’ interchangeably, what Keynes advocates here aligns far more
closely with a liberal technocratic model than with genuinely democratic
control.
93 <#reference-93> Keynes, ‘How Much Does Finance Matter?’, /Collected
Writings/, /Vol. 27/, p. 270. Keynes’s vision of the New Jerusalem,
though morally expansive, also remained highly technocratic. He assumed
that the content of a good life—refinement, cultural opportunity, urban
beauty—would be self-evident in a society freed from the pressures of
accumulation. What’s missing is any sense that competing visions of the
future might persist, or that trade-offs among social goals would
require political negotiation. His optimism seems grounded in a widely
held belief among neoclassical economists that material abundance would
render all such conflicts irrelevant.
94 <#reference-94> William Beveridge, /Full Employment in a Free
Society/, London 1944, pp. 177–8. Beveridge (1879–1963), a youthful
Fabian, was recruited as a civil servant to the Board of Trade (1908–
19), served as Director of the London School of Economics (1919–38),
returned to government service as a wartime adviser, then entered
Parliament as a Liberal mp.
95 <#reference-95> Beveridge, /Full Employment in a Free Society/, pp.
152–9. Beveridge followed Keynes’s three-phase postwar plan, ‘The Long-
Term Problem of Full Employment’, /Collected Writings/, /Vol. 27,/ pp.
320–5. The main difference is that Beveridge refrains from discussing
the third period, Keynes’s ‘golden age’, in terms of the reduction of
the rate of profit to zero.
96 <#reference-96> Beveridge, /Full Employment in a Free Society/, pp.
21–3.
97 <#reference-97> Crotty, /Keynes against Capitalism/, pp. 78–82.
98 <#reference-98> Kalecki, ‘Political Aspects of Full Employment’.
Beveridge noted this objection. It could be argued, he says, that a
‘State policy of full employment will always be liable to sabotage by
capitalists desiring to make difficulties for the State’ and that ‘the
piling up of wealth’ among the rich, as a result of these same policies,
might ‘be used to manipulate the political machine’: /Full Employment in
a Free Society/, p. 206.
99 <#reference-99> Beveridge, /Full Employment in a Free Society/, pp.
198–201. Gösta Rehn and Rudolf Meidner argued, against Beveridge, that
unions should embrace the wage pressure that comes with full employment,
coordinating rising wage demands across the economy. Firms unable to
maintain sufficient productivity would exit, enabling the economy to
shift resources towards more dynamic sectors. See Erik Bengtsson, ‘The
Origins of the Swedish Wage Bargaining Model’, /International Labour and
Working-Class History/, vol. 103, Spring 2023.
100 <#reference-100> See for example, Mariana Mazzucato, /The
Entrepreneurial State/, London 2013; and /Mission Economy/,//London
2021. See also Dani Rodrik /et al./, ‘The New Economics of Industrial
Policy’, /Annual Review of Economics/, vol. 16, 2024.
101 <#reference-101> This reflects a deeper structural problem in
contemporary mission-oriented frameworks. Thinkers like Mariana
Mazzucato emphasize the role of public investment in shaping innovation
and directing markets towards long-term social goals, but leave the
structure of private production intact—assuming that firms will continue
to respond to profitability, even as the state pursues broader values.
This is the inverse of Galbraith’s old adage: not ‘private opulence and
public squalor’, but ‘public purpose and private myopia’. See John
Kenneth Galbraith, /The Affluent Society/, Boston 1998 [1958], p. 203.
102 <#reference-102> Schumpeter, /Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy/,
p. 97. Schumpeter also notes that, in a socialist society, ‘there will
be plenty to fight about’, p. 213.
103 <#reference-103> The social transformation of investment would also
be central to two models for a socialist economy developed in the 1980s
and 90s: Pat Devine’s /Democracy and Economic Planning/ and David
Schweickart’s /Against Capitalism/. Devine comes closest to treating
investment as a political procedure, although—as discussed above—within
a framework of negotiated coordination, where firms and communities
propose and revise investment plans through participatory mechanisms.
For Devine, investment is framed as a site of deliberative convergence
rather than of political contestation. In Schweickart’s model,
investment is socialized and, on the public side, politicized to some
extent. On the historical context, see Neil Warner, /Towards ‘No
Alternative’: The Rejection of Proposals for the Socialization of
Investment in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden, 1972–1991/ (PhD
diss., lse 2024). For an updated eco-socialist version of this model,
see Pat Devine and Fikret Adaman, ‘Democracy, Participation and Social
Planning’, in Clive Spash, ed., /Routledge Handbook of Ecological
Economics/, London 2017. Others have developed frameworks that rely on
Devine and Adaman’s insights into socialist investment but dispute their
way of integrating day-to-day firm operations: see Part 3 of David
Laibman, /Deep History: A Study in Social Evolution and Human
Potential/, New York 2007; Saros, /Information Technology and Socialist
Construction/; Benanav, ‘Socialist Investment, Dynamic Planning and the
Politics of Human Need’, /Rethinking Marxism/, vol. 34, no. 2, 2022.
104 <#reference-104> On firms as organizations that coordinate complex
knowledge through routines and accumulated know-how, see Herbert
Simon, /Administrative Behaviour/, New York 1947; Edith Penrose, /The
Theory of the Growth of the Firm/, Oxford 1959; Richard Nelson and
Sidney Winter, /An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change/, Cambridge ma
1982; and Giovanni Dosi, ‘Sources, Procedures and Microeconomic Effects
of Innovation’, /Journal of Economic Literature,/ vol. 26, no. 3,
September 1988.
105 <#reference-105> See Ralph Keeney and Howard Raiffa, /Decisions with
Multiple Objectives/, Cambridge 1976; and Amartya Sen, ‘Reason and
Justice: The Optimal and the Maximal’, /Philosophy/, vol. 92, no. 1,
January 2017. When the solution set contains many possible solutions,
additional rules can help narrow the set—such as eliminating options
that, for any one value, fall below a threshold like half the best
available outcome for that value. See Bernard Roy, /Multi-Criteria
Methodology for Decision Aiding/, London 1996; and Valerie Belton and
Theodor Stewart, /Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: An Integrated
Approach/, London//2002.
106 <#reference-106> See Amartya Sen, /Development as Freedom/, Oxford
1999; Martha Nussbaum, /Creating Capabilities: The Human Development
Approach/, Cambridge ma 2011; oecd, /How’s Life? Measuring Well-Being/,

Report/, New York, various years.
