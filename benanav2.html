    Institutions for a Multi-Criterial Economy

How might a modern economy work if it were driven by multiple social
goals instead of the pursuit of private profit? The first part of this
contribution discussed the ways the classical socialist tradition
addressed this question, from the nineteenth-century utopians to the
crash industrializers of Soviet Russia, the planners of Red Vienna, the
guild socialists of Edwardian Britain and the architects of the postwar
welfare state.footnote^1 <#note-1> A major problem they failed to
resolve was how to design the institutions through which multiple
democratically determined aims could be articulated and composed, with
resources allocated accordingly. Early ideas of a simple community-
regulated economy could not survive the growing differentiation of
economic and social structures thrown up by capitalist development from
the 1870s on, which had created complex, layered processes of production
and correspondingly specialized, sometimes mutually unintelligible forms
of knowledge and world outlooks. New social struggles—feminist, anti-
colonial, anti-racist—advanced competing, perhaps incompatible values:
autonomy, equality, recognition. Imposing a uniform plan overrode
broader aims in pursuit of maximized output and ignored real local
differences, with perverse results.

Organizing an economy around multiple goals dramatically increases the
complexity of decision-making. Enduring ethical and political
disagreements will persist. Even if broad consensus were achieved,
material and technical constraints would mean that not all ambitions
could be realized, requiring negotiated trade-offs. Besides, irreducible
uncertainty about the future means we can never wholly predict the
consequences of our decisions or anticipate new wants and needs; course
correction has to be part of the decision-making process. The result
will necessarily involve ongoing political contestation. As Otto Neurath
recognized, this means that the institutions of a multi-criterial
economy should be designed not to suppress disagreements but to
articulate them as intelligible alternatives and to structure the
choices among them.footnote^2 <#note-2> Neurath and his followers in
1920s Vienna made some headway, but the rise of Nazism crushed and
scattered them before they could figure out what needed to be done.

The theoretical starting point here picks up from Neurath’s insight that
different goals and values—like good-quality work and housing for all,
or sustainable agriculture and ecological balance—are not substitutable;
they cannot be reduced to a single metric and ranked or ‘optimized’
accordingly. Their benefits need to be expressed /in kind/, for what
they are themselves, and evaluated on that basis.footnote^3 <#note-3>
Some courses of action can be ruled out from the start, if they cost
more and deliver less across all relevant dimensions—they are
‘dominated’ options, in the terms of rational-choice theory. But among
the viable options that remain, there may be no automatic way to
determine the best; no algorithm to make the final choice. They present
what are known as partial-order problems, in that they can be partially
ranked and ordered, but not fully so. Partial-order problems arise at
every level of economic life: in households, deciding how to allocate
time and resources; in firms, selecting inputs and production methods;
in investment bodies, weighing competing futures. From a technical
standpoint, there may be no single optimal answer. But from an economic
and political perspective, a choice must still be made.footnote^4
<#note-4> This requires a shift from optimization to composition, and
from theory to practice. The question becomes: how can the composition
of our values be organized institutionally under real-world conditions?

In what follows, I start with a brief overview of the institutional
ensemble that will allow a multi-criterial economy to flourish. I then
discuss in more detail the thinking about how each would operate, what
capitalist practices it would replace and what the social effects would
be. It should be stressed, first, that this is not a blueprint. It
simply sketches mechanisms by which the challenge of replacing the
profit drive by other, contestable values might be met. It should thus
be seen as a framework for institutional design—necessarily
underspecified, with the names of the institutions deliberately plain
and bald; operating at a level of abstraction sufficient for the ideas
to be applicable in varied national contexts, adaptable to specific
cultures, histories and struggles. Second, it is not a theory of what
those values should be. I have my own views about what matters most—how
we should respond to climate change, for example, and what kind of world
we should build in its wake. But readers will not find those views here.
The aim is not to prescribe an ideal outcome, but to suggest a framework
within which people can debate and resolve those questions
themselves.footnote^5 <#note-5>

Yet no system of collective choice can be legitimate if people lack
access to livelihood, education, health, time or voice. Without a
commitment to a shared baseline of rights and entitlements, without real
freedoms and material guarantees, deliberation would be hollow. How
those rights are defined and what they include will vary. But this
framework assumes that the provision of universal basic services and
income is the enabling condition for people to engage fully and freely
in the decisions that structure their world. That is what makes the
project emancipatory—what makes it socialist.


      1. overview: beyond the profit motive

The framework for a multi-criterial economy envisaged here implies a
series of structural breaks. Capital accumulation and waged labour are
both abolished. Investment is no longer driven by the pursuit of profit
but by the purpose of meeting socially defined needs, while sustaining a
wider diversity of ends that individuals and communities choose to
pursue. Workers no longer depend upon their employers for their income,
which is supplied instead by the Technical Associations and ubi. All
providers—whether offering public or private goods and services—are non-
profit entities. The framework proposes a large role for public
provision, especially in sectors like housing, education, health, care
and culture, which will absorb significant quantities of labour and
resources. But consumer markets will remain vital arenas for personal
choice.

Even where final consumption is largely de-commodified, production must
rely on extensive exchange among firms. We need only think of the wide
range of intermediate goods and services required to produce the most
basic final products. A bakery needs ovens, flour, cleaning services,
maintenance, accounting software, packaging, transportation and more. A
neighbourhood clinic relies on specialized equipment, sterilization
services, lab diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and repair technicians.
Inter-firm exchanges are essential to any complex economy, and firms
must be able to choose their suppliers, change them in response to
delays or quality issues, and experiment with new approaches and
partnerships. Market exchange enables this kind of flexibility and
responsiveness, especially when production is distributed across many
units.footnote^6 <#note-6>

The question, then, is not whether to have markets but how to organize
them without falling back into a narrow profit-driven logic, with firms
focused solely on the ‘efficiency’ of reducing costs and increasing
revenues as their overriding structural concern. A multi-criterial
economy cannot be organized this way. Its goal is not to eliminate the
value of economic efficiency, but to place it within a broader frame: to
weigh possible efficiency gains alongside other values, like
improvements in sustainability, work quality or neighbourhood cohesion.
This requires another structural break. Firms will no longer rely on
revenue surpluses to pay wages or finance future investments. Those
functions will be undertaken by democratically accountable Technical
Associations and Investment Boards. This framework preserves the
benefits of market exchange—responsiveness to changing conditions,
experimentation, innovation—where they matter most: in the inter-firm
exchanges that sustain the wider production process.

The introduction of a digital dual-currency monetary system is the
critical move in breaking the link between profits, wages and investment
—while retaining market exchange. Two distinct currencies structure
transactions: credits are used by individuals for personal consumption;
points are used by firms and associations for inter-organizational
transactions and investment. These currencies are not convertible—there
is no direct exchange rate between them. This separation ensures, first,
that incomes for consumption remain limited to that. Individuals cannot
use their credits to acquire productive assets, fund investments or
influence collective decisions. Disbursements to support civic,
political and associational life are made in the points currency—clearly
distinguishing them from credits for personal spending. Likewise, firms
cannot use points as a source of profit: points cannot be saved,
reinvested or converted into credit incomes. This breaks the structural
link between efficiency as such and private accumulation. It encourages
firms to spend their full operating budgets each cycle without being
driven to maximize surplus. It also makes possible a distinct,
democratically governed investment process—separate from firm operations
—through the Investment Boards, which allow other values to be brought
to bear in shaping the production process.

An open digital ledger, the Data Matrix, registers the flows of points
and credits, the latter in anonymized form, as they are disbursed and
spent. By tracking purchases in real time, it creates a vast statistical
mirror of the economy. Freely accessible, the Data Matrix can run
reports and queries on macro-economic trends or sectoral patterns on
request. Firms can use this to anticipate and adapt their production
schedules, reducing inventories to manage resources more effectively.
Crucially, each anonymized credit purchase can be linked downstream
through the points system, mapping how individual consumption choices
and firms’ production decisions propagate through wider supply chains,
making it possible to understand the broader economic effects that
purchases initiate. From this, a powerful forecasting infrastructure can
be built to illuminate possible futures. The Data Matrix allows anyone
to query the forecasts and run ‘what if?’ simulations to see what policy
or investment changes might produce different outcomes.

Within the framework envisaged here, individuals access resources
through four primary channels: universal basic services; a universal
basic income, denominated in credits; a work-based income, also paid in
credits; and a budget, denominated in free points, which they can
allocate to the civic, cultural and political organizations they
support, enabling these bodies—known as ‘Free Associations’—to operate
within the points economy. At the same time, the digital currencies are
issued under the discipline of an overall budget constraint, with macro
allocations across the economy decided by democratic debate. This gives
practical shape and urgency to the multi-criterial optimization process
described above. Each of the major economic actors—households, firms,
Investment Boards, Technical Associations—faces a composition problem:
how to weigh multiple incommensurable aims—such as security, autonomy,
meaning and efficiency—within limited envelopes of time, currency and
materials? The sum of their choices, informed by the Demos’s macro-
economic decisions, determines the shape and character of the multi-
criterial society.

The firm here refers to all producers, whatever their scale or
structure: own-account operators, small shops, larger cooperatives or
gigantic enterprises employing thousands. Firms are understood as
institutions that convene people with different skills and knowledge in
purposeful collaboration, structured by organizational routines, to
fulfil some socially identified need or desire.footnote^7 <#note-7>
Within the multi-criterial economy, they are established by Investment
Boards as worker-managed, publicly owned and non-profit, with a specific
allocation of points. Firms providing public-sector services—clinics,
libraries, housing associations, schools—receive a budget in points per
capita of the population served. Firms producing goods and services for
individual consumption receive points on the basis of their market share
of consumption spending. Operating within these budget constraints, all
firms must allocate their resources across competing aims: meeting high
standards of service or product quality, reducing ecological impact,
improving workplace conditions, building resilience to shocks or
maintaining internal democracy. Firms use some of their points to pay
Technical Associations for the hire of labour, the price of which
fluctuates with demand; other points are spent on renting publicly owned
land and infrastructure, or on inter-firm transactions. Firms also
produce proposals for future investment, for which fresh points will be
issued, as decided by their sectoral Investment Board.

Investment is the primary mechanism driving the transformation of the
economy over time. It is how society expands capacity, upgrades
equipment, or shifts direction entirely. In a multi-criterial economy,
investment is not guided by expected financial returns but by judgements
about how to prioritize among alternative futures. These decisions
unfold across three nested levels. Minor improvements are handled
through direct allocations to firms by the sectoral Investment Boards.
Larger projects and long-term strategies are the subject of informed
deliberation and voting by the Boards, which include elected
representatives from the workers in that sector, plus consumers,
communities and experts drawn from Technical Associations. Cross-
sectoral transformations—such as decarbonization, reparation of past
wrongs, or the reduction of the working week—are overseen by project-
specific Coordinating Committees. At each level, investment decisions
face the same challenge: how to weigh legitimate but often incompatible
priorities within the limits of available resources; budgetary
constraints again compel prioritization, helping to structure
disagreements and enable transparent composition among rival pathways,
as a collective procedure for navigating uncertainties and producing the
necessary trade-offs.

Labour is organized by a network of Technical Associations, building on
the models of professional guilds, trade unions and accreditation
bodies, but with an expanded mandate for recruitment and salary
disbursement, as well as training, further education and research. The
Technical Associations have special responsibility for integrating
technical expertise into public deliberation, electing expert
representatives to help guide strategic decisions. This encompasses not
just engineers and scientists, but also tradespeople, care workers,
cooks, cleaners and anyone whose know-how can help shape production and
provisioning. The Technical Associations’ internal activities are also
shaped by partial-order problems, as they determine how to allocate
limited resources—within the constraints set by their own associational
points budgets—across multiple missions and priorities, from recruitment
and training programmes to r /& / d.

Alongside them are civic and cultural Free Associations, supported by
funding through the ‘free points’ system. Together with the Technical
Associations, this layer sustains the cultural and intellectual life of
the society, animating a broader realm of collective endeavour—artistic
production, political organizing, independent research, religious
expression. Free Associations serve not just as value carriers but as
value creators, helping a society continually revisit and reshape what
it counts as worthwhile. While they define their own goals, and are not
charged with delivering socially mandated outcomes, the civic and
cultural associations still face their own composition problems:
choosing how to pursue plural goals within real budgetary constraints.


      2. a dual monetary system

In mainstream economics, markets are celebrated as mechanisms of self-
regulating efficiency: firms respond to price signals, adjust production
methods and compete by minimizing costs and maximizing output to earn
monetary rewards. Market competition resolves into a delicate dance of
rational coordination, allowing for efficient allocation without central
planning. A more critical tradition, rooted in Marxist economics, sees
this instead as a war for survival. Market efficiency, in this view, is
not a sign of harmony but the aggregate outcome of systemic compulsion,
locking firms into relentless competition, driven both by the incentive
to capture financial rewards and by the threat of losing market share.
For Marxists, these pressures drive firms not only to pursue product and
process innovation but also to deepen the exploitation of labour and the
environment, offloading costs onto society and crushing competitors to
secure monopoly rents.footnote^8 <#note-8>

Yet these contrasted perspectives share a common assumption. Whether
seen as elegant optimization machines or ruthless engines of
accumulation, markets are assumed to subordinate all other
considerations to a profit-driven, efficiency-first logic. But this
drive is not intrinsic to markets themselves. It arises because
participants in capitalist markets are motivated by the prospect of
monetary return. Firms seek profits, and it is this orientation—imposed
by the structure of ownership and competition—that is the overriding
imperative. To move beyond it, what must be severed is not the use of
markets, but the tie between market participation and profit-
seeking.footnote^9 <#note-9>

To do that, the financial pressures that currently structure firms’
decision-making must be removed. In a capitalist economy, profit is both
a source of income for owners and an important source of investment
funds for enterprises. Firms are thus compelled to generate, retain and
also distribute surpluses to their owners and creditors. That
accumulative imperative is what forces firms to privilege cost-
minimization and revenue-maximization above other goals. How can markets
retain their informational and adaptive value without reintroducing the
coercive dynamics of profitability? Firms still need to face budgetary
constraints, or else their decisions become arbitrary. But those
constraints must shape firms’ activity without demanding the
accumulation of monetary surpluses. This is precisely what the
introduction of a digital dual-currency system is designed to achieve.

Before the rise of modern capitalism, money did not function as a
single, universal medium. Most societies maintained multiple currencies
or currency-like tokens, each tailored to specific domains. Monetary
multiplicity was arguably a rational response to the differentiated
structure of exchange relations. One currency might be used in local
markets, another for long-distance trade, a third for religious
offerings or taxes. In West Africa, cowries, brass rods and cloth
circulated simultaneously, each corresponding to a particular kind of
transaction or social relationship. Modern money’s three core functions—
unit of account, medium of exchange, store of value—were divided across
these tokens. Different monies were thus also instruments of
institutional separation, maintaining the boundary between morally
distinct realms of life.footnote^10 <#note-10>

It was only with the rise of capitalism that money became increasingly
unified—both in form and in function—as part of a larger effort to
generalize the commodity form. This was not an evolutionary
inevitability, but a political and institutional project. As states
consolidated fiscal authority and capitalist markets expanded, older
systems of plural currencies were gradually dismantled. Beginning in
early modern Europe and accelerating in the nineteenth century, national
governments sought to impose a single legal tender, backed by
centralized tax systems and enforced through commercial law and monetary
administration. This new form of money was designed to be universal in
scope, abstract in form, and indifferent to context: it could mediate
any transaction, represent any good and bind any party, regardless of
social relation or moral standing. Its emergence coincided with the
spread of wage labour and the commodification of time, land and life
itself.footnote^11 <#note-11>

In Part One, I described how the Soviet Union inadvertently reintroduced
monetary plurality by dividing its national currency, the ruble, into
two distinct circuits: one for production, one for consumption. Within
the planned economy, enterprises operated entirely in non-cash rubles—an
internal accounting unit mediated by Gosbank, which authorized all
inter-enterprise transactions and blocked unauthorized flows. Cash
rubles, by contrast, circulated only in the consumer economy, entering
when wages were paid and exiting when households made purchases. This
institutional firewall between circuits was not a theoretical invention
but a practical solution to the growing complexity of the command
economy. For a time, this dual structure made centralized planning
workable at scale. But as Perestroika’s reforms loosened financial
controls, the firewall broke down. By the late 1980s, arrears ballooned,
deliveries failed and material flows became untrackable.

The credits and points system proposed here does not represent a break
with history so much as a return to something this earlier system
glimpsed but could not sustain. Unlike the Soviet model, this system
begins from the premise that economic coordination requires two distinct
currencies, each embedded in its own institutional and political logic.
The model also draws on the deeper historical precedent of monetary
multiplicity, in which different tokens governed different realms: here,
consumption is organized through credits, while production is
coordinated through points. Firms do not receive credits and cannot
spend or accumulate them. Firms producing goods and services for
consumers receive points in proportion to the share of all credits spent
by consumers on their products. These points are drawn from that portion
of the total social budget allocated to meeting consumer needs and
wants. points are not convertible into credits, and credits cannot be
used to acquire points. This structural separation is what makes it
possible to preserve market coordination without reverting to a profit-
driven system.footnote^12 <#note-12>

Because points cannot be hoarded, carried over or transformed into
personal gain, firms have no incentive to underspend their budgets or
generate surpluses. Unspent points depreciate and disappear after a
defined period, further encouraging firms to allocate their full budgets
each cycle in pursuit of their production goals. At the same time, firms
cannot use the operational points they acquire to finance investment:
upgrades and capacity expansions must be proposed and approved through
the separate Investment Board system. The result is a clean division of
functions. credits support consumption; they may be transferred in a
limited way between individuals but are removed from the system once
spent at consumer-facing firms.footnote^13 <#note-13> points finance
operational expenditures; they circulate in the production sphere for a
limited time but then are extinguished as well. By preventing the
accumulation of generalized purchasing power in either domain, this
system ensures that production decisions remain oriented toward
fulfilling social and ecological aims, rather than toward extracting
surpluses, which becomes functionally impossible.

Earlier attempts to separate circuits of production and consumption ran
up against a major structural weakness: they lacked a durable mechanism
to enforce the boundary. Separation depended on administrative fiat,
informal norms, or physical segregation, and once pressure built—through
opportunistic conversion, scarcity, or policy drift—leakage became
inevitable. What distinguishes the present model is that it learns from
these breakdowns. It does not rely on maintaining discipline through
bureaucracy alone but instead uses digital architecture to make the
separation enforceable by design. credits and points are legally
distinct and digitally incommensurable. They exist in separate circuits,
recorded in the Data Matrix, with no pathway for conversion. The credit
economy thus preserves a familiar form of economic agency—choosing how
to live—but places it within a system where, thanks to universal basic
services and income, no one must work to survive, and where production
is organized around the pursuit of plural ends.footnote^14 <#note-14>
credit budgets must be replenished each month to sustain purchasing power.

points, too, enter the system anew—at the start of every quarterly
production cycle. The Demos decides the overall shape of the economy by
periodically reevaluating what proportion of the total available points
should be allocated to each of the economy’s five domains: (i) public
universal provision; (ii) provision for individual consumption; (iii)
provision within the associative domain, which includes the Technical
Associations as well as the self-determining Free Associations; (iv) the
administrative domain, including the Investment Boards, Coordinating
Committees, Evaluation Bodies and Research Institutes that help to shape
the system as a whole; (v) the domain of future provisioning, allocating
investment for transformational infrastructural and technological
development. Individuals and associations can prompt the Data Matrix to
generate Neurath-style plan options showing what results different
points allocations would produce.footnote^15 <#note-15> For example, the
Demos could decide to allocate 25 per cent of points to public
provisioning, 25 per cent to production for individual consumption, 20
per cent to the associative domain, 15 per cent for administration and
15 per cent for future development. The significance lies not so much in
the ratios themselves as in the fact that they can change, through
political contestation over how needs and priorities are defined,
informed by forecasts and scenarios produced by the Data Matrix.


        Permanent stability

Once firms receive their operational points budgets, they are free to
allocate them to cover rental charges for the factors of production—
land, labour, capital goods—and buy intermediate inputs from other
producers.footnote^16 <#note-16> points used for rental charges are
stamped out of existence and removed from circulation, while those spent
on intermediate inputs pass on through the supply chain. All points
eventually exit the system, either through rental payments or by
expiring with the end of the production cycle, so firms have no
incentive to hoard or accumulate them. The production cycles overlap,
with new points injected at the pace that old ones leave the system,
ensuring continuous circulation. By adjusting the flow of new points to
match resources and productive capacity, the system ensures that
economic activity remains balanced, preventing both inflationary excess
and the under-utilization of resources.

This structure eliminates the need for taxation or debt-based money
creation. In capitalist economies, public goods and services appear to
be ‘funded’ by extracting revenue from private activity, creating the
illusion that taxation is necessary to sustain essential services and
infrastructure. In reality, public services exist because society
chooses to allocate labour, materials and capital toward them, not
because financial transfers make them possible. The multi-criterial
economy makes this explicit by directly allocating points to the domain
of public provision. Another contrast: under capitalism, savings appear
to be necessary to fund future investment, whereas here, investment is
not constrained by prior financial surpluses; setting aside points in
each cycle creates the necessary ‘savings’ for socially desired investment.

The points–credits system also has profound implications for the logic
of investment. In capitalist economies, investment only occurs when
firms expect future profits, leading to waves of expansion and
contraction. When anticipated returns are high, investment surges; when
expectations decline, firms cut back, leading to stagnation. These ups
and downs are further exacerbated by credit dynamics, as speculation and
interest-rate fluctuations determine the availability of funds. In the
multi-criterial economy, investment follows a different pattern. A fixed
share of points is automatically set aside in each production cycle and
used to fund the developments which the Demos—at local, regional or
national level—has decided are most important. These digital investment
resources are not accumulated by any individual or entity; they earn no
financial rate of return. Instead, they are created collectively and
allocated democratically in line with a variety of different ends.
Because investments are decoupled from profitability, they can be
directed towards whatever society considers most worthwhile.footnote^17
<#note-17>

The result is a form of permanent macroeconomic stability that
capitalism has never achieved. Because the investment process is neither
privately controlled nor limited to efficiency gains, the economy no
longer suffers from speculative booms or recessionary busts. This does
not mean inertia, simply that firms can operate from a stable platform,
focusing on improving what they do. Instead of investment surges and
collapses, the economy sees overlapping investment waves, shifting with
technological developments and evolving social priorities. At times,
investment may focus on efficiency gains—when new methods allow for
significant improvements in production processes. At others, it may be
aiming to reduce working hours, improve care infrastructure, increase
resilience or support community life. When one avenue of improvement
starts to become saturated or less urgent, investment can flow
elsewhere. Because points cannot be saved for later spending—they
function as a means of exchange but not as a store of value—their total
volume can be modulated each cycle to keep demand and supply in balance
overall. Local pinch-points and bottlenecks may still emerge, but these
can be monitored and addressed as they arise. This coherence is achieved
not through top-down planning or market discipline, but through
structured decision-making, in which decentralized action is aligned
with democratic priorities. In a multi-criterial society, baseline
macro-economic stability is built into the structure of the system.


      3. the data matrix

Past models of computational socialism imagined that centralizing a mass
of economic data could optimize the entire economy. Planners would feed
desired outputs, necessary inputs and available resources into a central
algorithm to produce a comprehensive blueprint. Yet even if a coherent
plan could be constructed, these efforts consistently failed in
practice. Firms lacked the flexibility to switch suppliers or try out
new ideas. Persistent quality issues and shortages were the
result.footnote^18 <#note-18> In the multi-criterial economy, no
algorithm or central authority dictates the details of production.
Instead, the role of the Data Matrix is to aid coordination by making
visible the broader consequences of individual production decisions.
Firms operate with open books, and points-based exchanges can be audited
at any time. Because every transaction is logged and auditable,
irregularities can be automatically flagged. Machine-learning algorithms
scan patterns of point spending, as well as anonymized credit spending,
to generate a powerful forecasting infrastructure.footnote^19 <#note-19>
Forecasts show us not what must happen, but what might—and what we
could, through collective effort, choose to alter. They don’t make the
rules; they offer recommendations, automatically generated through
digital analyses of data and trends.footnote^20 <#note-20> Economic
actors may choose to rely extensively on such automated guidance,
streamlining their operational decisions, or they may deliberately
override it. The Data Matrix system anticipates the ripple effects
specific choices would make but respects people’s judgement, under real-
world constraints.

This approach to big-data forecasting differs fundamentally from how
giant firms deploy it today. Amazon and Google mainly use their
proprietary data, which they jealously guard, to identify profitable
niches for new products; forecasting is oriented toward maximizing
returns.footnote^21 <#note-21> By contrast, the system described here
treats forecasting as an instrument of democratic awareness, helping to
open up the future as a field for action. Here, we can imagine a
Chatgpt-like interface, capable of rendering vast statistical matrices
into digestible narratives and visualizations for public consultation. A
journalist might query whether increased demand for electronics is
leading to greater electronic waste and see where that waste is going. A
community association might query what would happen if investment were
redirected towards denser public-housing models. Forecasting becomes
political; it shows, clearly, what existing or alternative choices might
achieve—or destroy.

This massive informational apparatus is institutionally open and
democratically governed. The Data Matrix is not an insulated
technocratic agency. Instead, it combines the expertise of professional
statisticians and data scientists with direct democratic input and
participation from worker groups, social movements and community
organizations. Members of the public can run their own queries,
generating hypothetical or counter-factual reports. New metrics are
debated, revised and contested, shaping methodologies of data collection
and interpretation. A care-workers’ association, for example, might
reject standard productivity-focused time-motion studies, advocating
instead for ethnographic logs and collaborative interviews that better
capture the nuanced realities of their work. Here, democracy operates at
an epistemic level: collectively determining how and what we know about
our conditions. The goal is a statistical system capable of ongoing
learning across a wide variety of social and ecological
dimensions.footnote^22 <#note-22>

No single metric can summarize this diversity; rather, the statistical
system must maintain parallel indicators—making visible tensions and
trade-offs among different criteria.footnote^23 <#note-23> While profit-
driven macro-economic management relies on a small set of aggregate
indicators—gdp, productivity, employment, inflation—a multi-criterial
society will need anonymized data across many more factors.footnote^24
<#note-24> The Data Matrix will need to encompass not just the spending
of credits and points, but also social indicators, tracking community
and workplace dynamics as well as measurements of subjective well-being.
Biophysical accounting will register all flows of energy, raw materials,
emissions and waste, organizing this data into input-output matrices
that could provide real-time visibility into ecological conditions—
carbon cycles, resource extraction rates relative to regeneration,
biodiversity losses, water use, soil depletion and pollution levels—thus
revealing the economy’s proximity to critical planetary boundaries.
Different production and consumption scenarios can then be modelled
within these constraints, clarifying the paths available and the social
or ecological consequences of pursuing them.footnote^25 <#note-25> Data
Matrix systems will be adaptive and responsive to emerging concerns; a
coalition representing disabled persons, for instance, could track the
navigability of public spaces, translating lived experience into
actionable data.

By linking credit-based consumption and point-based production data with
this expansive, democratically governed, computational-communicative
matrix, it will be possible to achieve a much greater degree of macro-
economic, biophysical and social stability. Changing patterns of
ecological overshoot, workplace burnout, social isolation or
psychological distress become visible in real time, shaping decisions
about where to invest resources. But it is equally important that they
directly inform operational decisions of firms. The economy becomes, in
short, self-reflective—not just stable in the aggregate, but responsive
to the multiplicity of values and conditions it must continually
balance. The result is a system that can sustain what earlier designs
only approximated: a sustainable, plural form of coordination in which
different domains of value—economic performance, ecological
responsibility and social purpose—remain linked but non-convertible.


      4. universal provision

A multi-criterial economy begins with a simple commitment: that everyone
should have secure access to the goods and services they need to
participate fully in society. The expansion of public provision has been
a fundamental goal for the left—socialist, social democratic and
Keynesian—for over a century. In the us such programmes remained
limited; welfare was racialized, means-tested and narrowly targeted. In
Europe, Christian Democrat governments constructed broader systems,
though they were always designed to reinforce traditional family roles.
In Britain, the Attlee government took initial steps towards a more
universal model, also built on the male-breadwinner ideal. Social
Democrats in the Nordic countries went further, building expansive
provision for education, healthcare, housing, childcare and transit. Yet
even in their most generous forms, these institutions remained partial
and embattled, built within capitalist systems that begrudged public
spending; most were hollowed out from the early 1980s.

A multi-criterial economy will aim to realize their unfinished promise,
making access to essential goods and services the foundation of society,
so that worries about survival can finally fade away. Under this system,
public provisioning encompasses not only housing, health, care,
education, libraries and transport systems, but also cell phones,
internet access, neighbourhood canteens, parenting support, laundries,
help for the elderly or disabled. The cultural and civic infrastructure
is equally expansive: free access to all books, films, music and news;
studios for audio and video production; media platforms of every type;
publicly maintained digital workspaces, gyms, pools, hiking trails,
saunas, gardens and spaces for celebration, grief and ritual.footnote^26
<#note-26>

One effect of expanded public provisioning would be the positive
reshaping of domestic life. Under capitalism, much of the labour of
survival—cooking, cleaning, caregiving—has been privatized, offloaded
onto households and within them, disproportionately onto women; where
these needs are met through the market, results are patchy, expensive
and unequal. The multi-criterial economy approaches care as a matter of
collective concern, met through universal services and public funding
for home care, allowing people to choose whether to live in shared
arrangements or alone, without those choices being dictated by financial
precarity or unequal burdens. The security that universal basic services
provide is not just a matter of fairness and compassion; it is also a
precondition for being able to participate in a society organized around
shared decisions over competing goals. When people are stressed about
making the rent, finding care or managing chronic illness, their worlds
narrow.footnote^27 <#note-27> Economic insecurity forces people to
sacrifice the future for the present, limiting their capacity and will
to participate in forward-looking structures. Guaranteed good-quality
provision helps to clear the mind.

Capitalism depends on public provision to supply a literate able-bodied
workforce, as well as urban infrastructure, policing, the judiciary and
so forth. But at the same time, employers rely on economic insecurity to
maintain workplace discipline and control over their workforces.
Universal services make labour less pliable and threaten capital’s
control over the terms of employment. Meanwhile, a deeper structural
dynamic has intensified this problem. Services like care, health and
education absorb growing shares of total employment, partly because
productivity growth in these sectors will always be relatively
low.footnote^28 <#note-28> Capitalist accounting treats these labour-
intensive sectors as cost sinks—inefficient and in need of cuts. As the
share of services in the economy grows, austerity deepens and essential
needs go unmet, since the cost of meeting them would draw spending away
from private consumption.

In a multi-criterial system, the role of essential services will be able
to expand much further. A socialist society will undoubtedly encompass a
large service economy, since it will be organized around meeting a wider
range of social and psychological needs. Sectors like care work,
education, health and recreation will continue to be marked by low
productivity growth, requiring a large share of society’s capacity. Yet
they are precisely the areas where multi-criterial investment can yield
the greatest returns, by enriching their social value and improving
their conditions of work. Public services need not be limited to
providing the basics; as universal access becomes the norm, they can
become sites of collective aspiration and enjoyment. Public housing can
be beautiful. Pools, libraries, transit systems and care centres can be
maintained at the highest level.footnote^29 <#note-29>

Firms producing goods and services for public provision—clinics, transit
systems, schools—are funded in points on a per capita basis relative to
the populations they serve. Like all firms within the multi-criterial
economy, they are established by the relevant Investment Board, assessed
by Evaluation Committees and are publicly owned, non-profit and worker-
run. Service users are also involved in the assessments, voting as
politically constituted communities to shape the systems they rely on.
They can draw on the resources of the Data Matrix to clarify the
implications of different provisioning possibilities, propose trade-offs
and monitor outcomes. Firm models can remain diverse, even within a
given community—childcare centres with different methodologies, for
example—so long as the underlying infrastructure is universal and
equitably supported. Funding can follow enrolment or usage, while
democratic structures ensure that the system remains open to revision,
contestation and ongoing improvement.

How far should public provisioning go? Should everything be free at the
point of use? Some goods and services are too varied, taste-driven or
context-specific to be organized through universal provisioning systems.
It makes more sense to access them through markets, not necessarily
because they are luxuries but because their value lies in enabling
choice and expressing difference: restaurants, clothes, haircuts,
cosmetics, furniture, vacations, pet care, forms of entertainment. In
these realms, markets preserve diversity rather than undermining it,
allowing people to seek novelty or craft identity in ways that universal
provisioning cannot easily match. A limited but free-to-use basic income
helps to support the personal character of this type of consumption,
supplemented by additional earnings from work-based salaries.footnote^30
<#note-30>

A degree of income inequality will remain, since certain demanding jobs—
late-night care work, long-distance haulage, specialized surgery,
underwater welding—will need greater remuneration to reflect their
particular burdens. In today’s economy, the ability to consume more and
work less is often reserved for those already possessing immense wealth,
or those who do work of questionable social value—speculating on
financial securities or maximizing online engagement—rather than those
performing essential but arduous tasks. A multi-criterial economy shifts
that pattern, enabling fairer distributions of effort and reward based
on negotiations across Technical Associations. Crucially, higher incomes
will no longer translate into greater social weight. Because of the
credits-points split, people cannot use higher credit earnings to
accumulate capital or hire lobbyists to influence collective decisions.
In a multi-criterial economy, the goal is not to eliminate all economic
inequality, but to ensure that differences in income among individuals
do not become differences in freedom.

This same principle applies at the collective level. Under capitalism,
the division of resources between universal public services and
individual discretionary spending is systematically skewed. Public
provision is treated as a cost to be minimized, while the growth of
private consumption is framed as the ultimate goal. A multi-criterial
economy redraws this line through democratic decision-making about how
much provisioning should be guaranteed to all and what should remain a
matter of individual responsibility. This is not a technical problem
that can be optimized by a computer or outsourced to experts. It is a
political question, shaped by different ideas of need and obligation.
What counts as a need is not fixed; needs are historically and socially
defined, shaped by shifting norms, evolving expectations and collective
struggle.footnote^31 <#note-31> How society draws this line conditions
the kinds of life choices individuals can realistically make.

So long as basic needs are guaranteed and income differences remain
modest, markets can help organize the trade-offs of personal lives
across many dimensions. Some may opt to work less and have more free
time; others may work more and spend more on travel, hobbies or home
comforts. Within this more equitable structure, individuals will still
need to navigate difficult personal choices, balancing incommensurable
aims: autonomy, connection, stability, achievement, leisure, personal
growth. A multi-criterial economy does not eliminate the hard choices
people have to make, but it ensures that, in making these choices, they
have a strong foundation of social support.


      5. worker-run firms

In a multi-criterial economy, firms operate with autonomy, but not
impunity. Each firm is established through an initial allocation of
points by a sectoral Investment Board and remains accountable to that
Board over time. The firm belongs to the people who work there, but not
in a capitalist sense; workers cannot buy or sell the firm’s productive
assets, nor draw income from its residual earnings. Instead, ownership
takes the form of collective self-governance: workers exercise authority
over internal decisions, selecting production methods, setting
priorities and navigating trade-offs among competing aims. Firms cannot
unilaterally expand their productive capacities—that requires Investment
Board approval—but they retain discretion over how they operate within a
given scale. They can change suppliers, introduce new processes, revise
outputs, and return unused resources to the broader economy. To protect
this autonomy, firms enjoy strong procedural rights. If they believe
they are being treated unfairly, they can appeal to an independent
judiciary empowered to hear and resolve such claims.

Firms’ autonomy is not a blank cheque. It is conditioned on performance
in meeting three interrelated goals. The first is to balance point
inflows and outflows over time, so that the firm uses its points budget
effectively without accumulating surpluses or running chronic deficits.
Second, the firm aims to maintain a good level of capacity utilization,
ensuring that resources are neither wasted nor stretched beyond their
limits. Third, it is expected to meet baseline multi-criterial standards
for social, environmental and workplace performance, as determined by
the Investment Board. The firm’s price-setting, in this context, is an
exercise in judgement: it must reflect its actual cost structure, its
anticipated demand, and the broader social aims it is trying to
serve.footnote^32 <#note-32>

Freed from the imperative to generate profit, the firm’s points budget
and working practices can help to support a wide range of
transformations: ecological restoration, new forms of mobility, enhanced
product quality, durable goods, workplace redesign, community well-
being, regeneration of public space. These benefits are measured in kind
—that is, in different units; their outcomes are not reducible to a
single metric and cannot be ranked on a common scale. As a result, there
is no optimal method of production. Each involves compromises, and
determining the best balance among competing priorities requires
ongoing, situated judgement. Workers themselves possess the local and
specific knowledge necessary to evaluate these trade-offs in context,
and they hold the right to decide collectively how to prioritize among
the goals their firm is pursuing. These decisions are necessarily
provisional and subject to debate at Investment Boards, where firms
across each sector learn from one another and make the case for their
way of resolving trade-offs.

At the same time, each individual firm’s performance is assessed by an
Evaluation Committee composed of stakeholders: workers from similar
firms, consumers, users, technical experts, representatives of affected
communities. Members are randomly selected by sortition to ensure
diversity and prevent capture. The process of evaluation is not
primarily about surveillance or discipline; it is designed to support
learning, adaptation and alignment. While financial balance can often be
assessed automatically, both capacity utilization and broader social
performance require judgement. The Evaluation Committee examines whether
the firm is meeting its stated objectives, how well it is managing
trade-offs among incommensurable goals and what adjustments might be
needed. It also asks whether firms are operating on or near the
‘production frontier’—delivering results across multiple dimensions
without excess waste or missed opportunity.

Firms are not passive recipients of these evaluations. They are given
space to explain and justify their choices—to show why certain trade-
offs were made, and how they weighed competing priorities within
budgetary constraints. The aim is not to identify a single correct path,
but to make sure firms are acting in good faith to compose multiple
values under constraint at or near the production frontier, rather than
drifting into efficiency-first habits, neglecting goals that cannot be
priced, or giving themselves too many perks. For most firms, evaluations
take place at regular intervals. But large or systemically important
firms are subject to continuous review, with rotating standing
committees to provide ongoing oversight. This ensures that influential
firms do not drift from their multi-criterial commitments or accumulate
informal power. If firms fail to meet standards or cannot resolve
conflicts on their own, a further mechanism exists: receivership, which
comes with a loss of autonomy and control over production decisions.

Receivership is not a punishment. It is a temporary intervention
designed to restore viability and uphold multi-criterial standards.
Firms may enter receivership involuntarily—due to persistent failure—or
voluntarily, if they are unable to resolve internal conflicts or manage
complex transitions. In either case, the goal is rehabilitation, not
liquidation. Only if recovery proves unworkable does dissolution occur
and resources are reallocated. When a firm is wound down for reasons
beyond its employees’ control, they retain salary support and can access
retraining or reassignment programmes. In this way, receivership
functions not as a disciplinary tool, but as a mechanism for structured
economic adaptation, ensuring that production remains responsive to
collective priorities.

Under the dual-currency system, firms experience real budget constraints
without being forced into efficiency-first competition. In this
environment, firms are not flying blind. Because investment decisions
are made publicly and all firms operate with open books, they can plan
in relation to one another. They know what changes are coming, where
supply is likely to expand or contract and how their own efforts fit
into the evolving landscape of their industry. Coordination is not
imposed from above but emerges from shared visibility and mutual
adjustment. The break with capitalism’s profit-driven logic also makes
it possible to reorganize firms around democratic governance and
decentralized decision-making, in place of hierarchical management
structures.


        Workplace freedoms

Worker-managed firms have often been viewed as unsustainable. Critics
argue that they are reluctant to hire new employees, as doing so dilutes
existing workers’ incomes; that they tend to underinvest, favouring
higher worker incomes over long-term expansion; that to succeed, they
will ultimately need to mimic the profit-driven strategies of
conventional capitalist firms, making workplace democracy nothing more
than a rubber stamping of regular managerial priorities.footnote^33
<#note-33> These are real concerns, but they point not to inherent flaws
in worker self-management but rather to the pitfalls of operating such
firms within a profit-driven economy. A multi-criterial economy removes
those pressures. Salaries, denominated in credits, are set externally by
the Technical Associations rather than by firms, removing the temptation
to maximize wages at the expense of the firm’s long-term health.
Investment is allocated by the relevant Board, eliminating the need for
firms to withhold funds for future growth.

As a result, worker-managed firms can become the default model of
production, with organizational structures depending on the nature of
their work. In some sectors, small, self-managed teams can handle their
tasks autonomously. Others will need to coordinate production between
those responsible for different stages of the firm’s workflow. In some
instances these approaches will be combined, allowing teams to manage
specialized tasks while contracting with others on shared projects. A
common objection to worker-management made by workers themselves is that
it requires endless meetings. But meetings proliferate in capitalist
firms as well, often without a clear purpose. In worker-run firms,
meetings should take place only when they involve irreversible
decisions, significant operational risk or coordination across multiple
teams. In other cases, firms can rely on an advising system, similar to
those used in the most effective ‘flat firms’ today. Individual workers
retain decision-making authority over their own tasks but are required
to consult those affected by their choices. The system helps foster a
sense of responsibility and confidence in one’s own judgement, qualities
that extend beyond the workplace and lay the foundations for the full
mobilization of collective knowledge.footnote^34 <#note-34>

In capitalist firms, workers develop an immense body of experience—
practical problem-solving, workflow adaptations, innovative technical
approaches—but it is largely subordinated to the imperatives of revenue
maximization. In a multi-criterial economy the firm becomes a site for
problem-solving, where workers are encouraged to bring their skills,
experience and judgement to bear in proposing innovations and
experimenting with new ways of organizing production. What looks at
first like a set of constraints—no retained earnings, no profit targets,
no control over expansion—turns out to be a form of freedom. Firms are
no longer forced to navigate credit markets or chase revenue in order to
expand. Instead, they receive an operating budget and a clear set of
goals. Within these parameters, they are free to concentrate on the
substance of their work: to improve practices, share ideas and test
innovations without being steered by profit imperatives.

That freedom also transforms the motivation to work. Under capitalism,
workers are often compelled to sacrifice the wide variety of goals they
regard as meaningful—such as concern for quality, care and
sustainability—in order to meet efficiency targets. When other goals are
introduced, they appear as performance metrics to be gamed, always
subordinated to the overriding aim of making money. In a multi-criterial
economy this logic is broken. Intrinsically worthwhile goals such as
ecological balance or workplace well-being can be treated as ends in
themselves, to be balanced collectively within the limits of available
resources.footnote^35 <#note-35>

Among the goals worth pursuing for their own sake, the improvement of
work and the reduction of working hours stand out as central. Firms are
encouraged to redesign tasks and workflows to enhance autonomy,
engagement and satisfaction. Outside experts—engineers, workplace
designers, organizational psychologists—can be brought in to help
reshape tasks and environments in ways that support intrinsic
motivation.footnote^36 <#note-36> Repetitive tasks are eliminated
wherever possible, not because they are inefficient, but because they
degrade the experience of work. Where repetitive tasks remain necessary,
their burdens should be fairly distributed, through rotation or
structural adjustments, so that no group is permanently assigned the
least desirable work.footnote^37 <#note-37> The balance between reducing
working hours and improving work quality is determined democratically,
at the level of the firm, the sector and the wider society. A multi-
criterial economy does not demand that work should be the primary site
of meaning in life; unlike earlier socialist traditions, which placed
labour at the centre of self-realization, this allows people to treat it
as one domain of meaning-making among many. At the same time, firms—
sometimes working with other community groups and associations—can aim
to shape the wider social environment in which its workers live by
developing investment proposals for consideration by their Investment
Board.


      6. investment boards

As the Keynesians saw, the operational level of the economy—the
production and distribution of goods and services—is structured and
developed through society’s investment function. Present capacities are
the accretions of the investment decisions of the past. In a multi-
criterial economy, the decisions of democratically constituted
Investment Boards determine what kinds of material, infrastructure and
organizational capacity will be available in each cycle of production.
Each Investment Board oversees a distinct sector, such as durable
manufacturing, transportation, food services, housing and commercial
space, safety and justice, healthcare.footnote^38 <#note-38> These
Boards set up firms, change them and close them down. They allocate the
points to build factories and transit networks, reconfigure supply
chains, embed software systems and introduce new tools and workflows.
Investment can also be directed towards the reorganization of work, the
retrofitting of homes for comfort and sustainability, the expansion of
care infrastructure and the cultivation of public goods, from green
spaces to crèches and libraries, that enrich the texture of everyday
life. A social survey or other instrument could be used to determine how
points allocated to investment are distributed across the various
Boards, thus determining their annual budgets.

Investment Boards are political assemblies—one for each sector—composed
of workers, consumers, community representatives and technical
experts.footnote^39 <#note-39> In essence, they represent a form of
collective self-management of an industry, encompassing not only those
who produce goods and services but also those who rely on them. The
Boards provide a space for debate, coalition-building and decision-
making: an institutional infrastructure that enables the economy to be
governed as a collective project. Because they are sites of political
contestation, democratic composition is crucial. Workers have a direct
knowledge of the industry in question—and a direct interest in
investments that could improve working conditions—so they have an
essential role to play. Users and customers help ensure that investment
decisions prioritize product quality, affordability and accessibility.
Representatives from community groups and civic associations offer a
wider social perspective on the sector. Technical experts bring
specialized knowledge, helping assess the feasibility and coherence of
competing proposals.

Various electoral designs might be envisaged for bringing together these
stakeholder groups. One option would be to organize Investment Board
elections sectorally, with workers, consumers and community
representatives voting for their sector’s representatives every few
years. This model emphasizes proximity and participation: those with
direct experience in an industry would have the most influence over its
development. A second option would be a general election to the
Investment Boards, based on proportional representation, in which
political parties or coalitions compete over the society-wide direction
of investment. A national vote could determine the composition of all
Boards, with seats allocated proportionally. This model ensures that the
Boards reflect broader ideological orientations rather than functioning
as isolated policy arenas.

A third model would be bicameral. Each Board would consist first of a
Sectoral Assembly, composed of workers and consumers who directly assess
and propose investment plans, and second of a Social Priorities
Assembly, elected through a general proportional vote to review those
plans and either ratify or send them back for revision. This would
prevent sectoral Boards from pursuing isolated agendas while ensuring
that large-scale ideological shifts are reflected in policy. If the two
chambers became deadlocked, a snap election within that sector could
resolve the impasse. The multi-criterial framework is flexible with
regard to which model is chosen. What matters most is that investment
remains an open arena of contestation—one where competing perspectives
can be fought for—rather than defaulting to bureaucratic inertia or
elite control.footnote^40 <#note-40>

Another question is whether technical experts should hold voting power
on Investment Boards. One option is to grant experts full voting rights,
ensuring that engineering, ecological, logistical and scientific
knowledge is embedded at the heart of the process. A second option
positions experts as external advisers, without voting power. In either
case, experts should be chosen by democratic elections within their
Technical Associations, rather than appointment by political leaders—
recognizing expertise as an organized form of collective knowledge, not
a personal credential.footnote^41 <#note-41> A further layer of
democratic participation could come in the form of Citizen Panels,
assembled through sortition to oversee Investment Board performance,
producing public reports that can inform future electoral choices.
However, the legitimacy of investment decisions depends on people having
a direct say in shaping outcomes, and that requires political
representation.footnote^42 <#note-42>

People must be able to campaign for what they believe in, vote for
representatives who share their priorities and hold them accountable
through public scrutiny and the power to remove them from office. There
is good reason to expect representative government to function better in
this setting, since political debate is no longer skewed by concentrated
wealth or constrained by the threat of capital flight. As noted above,
each member of the Demos receives an equal-sized free points budget,
which they can allocate to Free Associations, including those dedicated
to political agitation or the contestation of elections. While vested
interests may still exist—no system can eliminate them entirely—their
reach is sharply constrained. There are no profits to defend, no private
fortunes to be made from steering investment decisions. And crucially,
the economy itself is not structured in a way that pits democracy
against economic performance. In capitalist systems, efforts to reflect
popular values in economic life often come at the cost of investor
confidence. Here, the system is designed to respond to the values that
people actually hold. Democratic decisions concerning those values are
the very means through which the economy moves forward.

Each investment cycle begins with the Investment Boards reviewing
comprehensive data on sectoral conditions. The Data Matrix provides
multi-dimensional insights into economic, ecological, social and
subjective conditions. These diverse indicators are not aggregated into
a single composite score but intentionally presented as divergent
signals, emphasizing real tensions between priorities. As we’ve seen,
Neurath-style visualizations can help Boards situate sectoral conditions
within the economy as a whole, showing linkages to other sectors and
relationships to larger ecological and social aggregates. Intuitive
interfaces allow Board members and stakeholders to explore the data
interactively, running hypothetical scenarios forecasting what would
happen if investment priorities shifted. Expert testimony and
stakeholder input complement these quantitative metrics, offering
qualitative evaluations of the sector’s most pressing challenges.

Once an Investment Board has received its allocation of points, it
issues calls for investment proposals. Representatives of workers,
customers, community members and technical experts may announce the
problems they want to solve or the goals they want to promote, but these
guidelines do not set fixed boundaries. Proposals can respond directly
to those priorities, or they can introduce new possibilities—drawing
attention to challenges or innovations that haven’t yet been identified.
Investment proposals often originate from within existing firms, whose
workers are well positioned to identify bottlenecks or opportunities for
improvement; their direct engagement with production allows them to
envisage possibilities that external decision-makers might overlook.
Investment proposals can also argue for start-up firms; Investment
Boards reserve a portion of their points for new ventures, ensuring that
emerging firms have access to early-stage support for premises, capital
equipment and labour. Many proposals will arise from collaboration with
research institutes, consultancies and civic associations. A community
organization focused on urban mobility may develop a proposal for
expanding public-transit infrastructure and seek out elements within the
transportation sector capable of implementing it. A research institute
working on sustainable materials may collaborate with firms in
construction to transition away from traditional inputs. Every proposal
must be linked to a firm capable of implementing it, ensuring that
projects are not only interesting but also practically feasible.

Investment proposals are structured documents that specify feasibility,
budget requirements, supply-chain implications and potential risks, as
well as articulating the intended contribution to broader social goals.
Since developing proposals involves a significant amount of work, firms
receive recognition and compensation for their efforts. Material
incentives may take the form of bonuses in credits, providing fair
recompense for the time spent. But the deeper motivation is intrinsic:
the opportunity to contribute to meaningful innovation and shape the
trajectory of economic development. In this sense, competition for
investment funds in a multi-criterial economy resembles competition in
the sciences more than a capitalist market. Scientists do not pursue
discoveries primarily for financial gain but for recognition, the
ability to shape their field and the satisfaction of producing knowledge
that benefits society. Public recognition plays a crucial role in this
dynamic: firms that repeatedly develop successful innovations gain
credibility with Investment Boards, making it easier to secure funding
in the future.footnote^43 <#note-43> Because investment proposals and
point transactions are fully public, firms are not navigating in
isolation or attempting to outmanoeuvre competitors through proprietary
knowledge. Instead, they operate within an open and highly coordinated
environment, fostering collaborative forms of competition.

The Investment Board’s selection from the proposals operates within
strict budget constraints. Each Board should aim to spend 100 per cent
of its portion of the total investment points disbursed during each
investment cycle. Some are pre-allocated directly to firms through a
fast-track process, enabling incremental upgrades and maintenance. The
remaining funds are strategically allocated across a range of needs:
supporting new proposals, accelerating the adoption of proven
innovations, incubating new firms, restructuring failing ones and
maintaining long-term funding commitments for multi-year
transformations. Within these limits, the selection process is not about
choosing the most compelling individual proposals but assembling a set
of investments that will shape the sector in a coherent and forward-
looking way. While investment proposals are not algorithmically ranked
or reduced to numerical scores, they undergo graded assessments prepared
by sectoral-board staff, primarily to test the accuracy of cost
estimates. These assessments help Board members screen out proposals
that seem unlikely to deliver. But technical grading can only go so far:
benefits cannot be reduced to a common scale. People reasonably disagree
about which criteria matter most, how to define and pursue them, and how
to weigh them against each other. Social values therefore cannot be
treated as static inputs to be engineered into the system; they emerge
dynamically through the pattern of investments over time, revealing
which priorities the Investment Boards—and the broader public—consider
most important.

Board members deliberate openly over the trade-offs that selecting a
particular set of proposals embodies. They can draw on concurrent
discussions occurring in public forums that allow community groups,
ecological monitors, adjacent-sector representatives and others to voice
support or concerns. Stakeholders can also formally present their views
to the Investment Board and argue for specific investments. Technical
experts provide testimony and analysis at Board members’ request.
Integrating both stakeholder deliberations and expert insights ensures
that investment decisions are both informed and broadly legitimate, even
if they are irreducibly political.

The Investment Board then votes on which proposals to approve. The
voting process could be structured in different ways, with the goal of
ensuring broad-based approval rather than domination by any single
stakeholder group. However, sometimes sets of proposals will address the
same issue in fundamentally different ways. When proposals are
compatible—such as different models for transit expansion—Investment
Boards may approve several, fostering differentiation and
experimentation. When only one option can proceed, Boards would use a
run-off voting process to determine the preferred path. In cases where
representatives judge that a proposal would be actively harmful to long-
term societal goals—such as by overshooting ecological limits or
undermining social priorities—they can trigger a veto process to
determine whether the proposal should be blocked. Blocked proposals can
be revised and resubmitted in future cycles. In this way, veto power
ensures that critical protections are enforced without closing off the
possibility of negotiated transformation over time.


        Synchronizing transformation

Because their domains are sector-specific, Investment Boards do not
impose a fully coherent, centralized plan for the economy from above,
but coordination and compromise will often emerge organically through
this process. Board members will recognize interdependencies between
investments and build coalitions to strengthen support. But the system
does not depend on consensus. Because the investment process is
structured around voting, not unanimity, the economy moves forward even
when Board members’ priorities diverge and conflicts are unresolved. The
goal is not to eliminate political contestation, but to institutionalize
it—to make structured disagreement the engine of decision-making rather
than its breakdown.footnote^44 <#note-44>

Once the Board has disbursed the agreed points allocations, the firms
set about implementing their proposals. As discussed above, the outcomes
of investment projects are assessed by Evaluation Committees, composed
of workers, consumers, technical experts and community representatives.
They also consider what new questions have emerged, illuminating
unforeseen outcomes and suggesting fresh lines of inquiry. In large
corporations and bureaucratic government agencies, failed projects are
often concealed to protect reputations; multi-criterial evaluations
ensure that ineffective investments are publicly acknowledged. The Data
Matrix can supply additional insights, helping Evaluation Committees and
Investment Boards decide which projects should be cancelled,
restructured or fast-tracked for broader adoption across the sector. But
the evaluation process is not just about determining success or failure;
it is about collective learning. Firms build reputations for consistency
in meeting multi-criterial commitments, or willingness to lead on
pioneering issues. Similarly, Investment Board members—and their
political coalitions—are evaluated by stakeholders and voters on how
effectively their investment decisions have held up. This iterative
evaluation process transforms investment into an ongoing democratic
experiment, continuously adapting to the new conditions.

Some investment decisions cannot be left to the sectoral Investment
Boards’ incremental and exploratory process. They require broad,
synchronized action across multiple sectors. For these, there are
Coordinating Committees: institutions designed to drive society-wide
transformations that require cross-sectoral alignment. During periods of
rapid change—including the early stages of the transition to a multi-
criterial economy—Coordinating Committees could become the primary
instruments through which investment funds are channelled. Their aim is
to steer economic change to achieve major objectives, in a way that
overcomes bottlenecks and inertia, allowing society to move forward
without waiting for each sector to work out its own course. This does
not mean centralized economic planning in the traditional sense. There
is no master blueprint, dictating how all the pieces must fit together.
Instead, the Demos selects a number of overarching priorities and
directs a portion of investment funds toward them. In this sense,
Coordinating Committees serve as the industrial-policy mechanism of a
multi-criterial economy: targeted, time-limited and democratically
structured efforts at large-scale coordination—similar in function to
five-year plans in traditional planned economies or contemporary China
and Vietnam, but embedded within a contested political system rather
than imposed from above.footnote^45 <#note-45>

Each Coordinating Committee is funded through a set-aside share of
investment points; for instance, 10 per cent of total funds might be
allocated to a particular Committee, if the polity determines that is
warranted. Unlike Investment Boards, which manage ongoing sectoral
investments, Coordinating Committees have fixed time horizons, ensuring
that their mandates remain focused. Membership of these Committees could
be determined in multiple ways, blending technical expertise with
democratic accountability. Once it is constituted, the Coordinating
Committee’s first task is to map out different possible pathways for
achieving its goal. If the focus is a green transition, for instance, it
might develop several competing models for phasing out fossil fuels and
restructuring key industries. These proposals are then presented for
public discussion. Sortition-based citizen assemblies might evaluate the
proposals, drawing on expert testimony, modelling projections and
stakeholder consultation. Then, a society-wide referendum is held to
choose among the competing proposals. This grants democratic legitimacy
to the selected pathway, giving the Coordinating Committee a mandate to
proceed.

Crucially, the Committee does not bypass the Investment Boards; its
proposals must still pass through the normal investment process. What
the Committees does is shift the economic calculus for firms and
Investment Boards by covering the costs of aligned projects. If an
Investment Board approves a project that furthers the Coordinating
Committee’s mandate, funds from the Committee offset the project’s cost,
eliminating the financial burden from the Board’s perspective. In this
way, Coordinating Committees deliberately soften the budget constraints
facing investment decisions—a necessary feature for driving large-scale
structural change. However, this softening is carefully limited: it
applies only to investment costs, not to firms’ ongoing operational
budgets.footnote^46 <#note-46>

The final component of the investment system is the General Facilitation
Committee, which aids other investment-coordinating bodies when
bottlenecks arise. Unlike the sectoral Investment Boards, which focus on
within-sector decision-making, or the issue-specific Coordinating
Committees, which direct investment toward major transformations, the
General Facilitation Committee does not have an active political agenda
but helps resolve cross-sectoral conflicts that emerge organically from
the investment process. For example, if two sectors require a
simultaneous infrastructure expansion—say, energy storage and
electrified transportation—but each Investment Board hesitates to move
forward without the other, the General Facilitation Committee can
allocate funds to encourage synchronized development. By resolving these
emergent interdependencies, it helps avoid potential industrial-policy
coordination failures.

Historically, industrial policy has been narrowly deployed to scale up
manufacturing for wartime mobilization. Its deeper potential lies in
generalizing this approach across multiple dimensions of social life.
The green transition is an obvious candidate for Coordinating Committee
intervention, but the model could be extended to any democratically
desired transformations: work quality, collective care and democratic
renewal, alongside traditional economic and infrastructural goals. One
Coordinating Committee might drive the replacement of plastics with
sustainable alternatives, funding r /&/ d, infrastructure shifts and
consumer adaptation strategies. Another might push for a four-day
workweek by supporting productivity-enhancing automation, invest in
improved work quality for neglected occupations like care workers, cooks
and cleaners, or prepare for the challenges of large-scale climate
migration by creating welcoming, resilient cities. Given the finite
capacity of society to focus simultaneously on different large-scale
transformations, the number of active Coordinating Committees would be
limited; a reasonable framework might allow up to three to operate at
any given time. At the end of a Committee’s mandate, its impact would be
evaluated. If it has successfully completed its objectives, it is
dissolved. If the goal remains partially unmet but still relevant, the
Demos can vote to renew its mandate.


      7. technical associations

A technologically complex society requires a highly specialized division
of labour. Unlike some visions of a world after capitalism which imagine
that generalist skills will become the norm, the multi-criterial economy
takes the trajectory of technological progress seriously. It does not
require fewer specialists but more, spread across an expanding array of
disciplines. Specialization is not an accidental feature of modern
production but a necessary condition for sustaining a technologically
advanced economy. A single industrial process might involve mechanical
engineers, software developers, materials scientists, interface
designers and supply-chain specialists. Progress happens not by
flattening specialization but by integrating diverse forms of expertise
across complex systems. In such a society, expertise must not remain the
privilege of a few. Instead of abolishing professionalization, it must
be universalized: everyone could be an expert in something, and many
could acquire multiple competencies over the course of their lives.
Sustaining a multi-criterial economy therefore requires an institutional
framework that fosters expertise, integrating it into democratic
economic decision-making.

This is the role of the Technical Associations. As we’ve noted, they
build on the model of professional guilds or unions, but go far beyond;
they are responsible for training, certification, internal professional
standards and the integration of expertise into the investment-planning
process. Technical Associations ensure that every field has a structured
process for educating new entrants and recognizing their competence.
Some fields such as education, medicine and law already have strong
professional traditions. Others might need to develop or expand them—for
example, logistics, sanitation, food preparation, eldercare, homemaking,
childcare and community health. Every socially necessary task, whether
historically valorized or neglected, becomes a site of structured
training, evolving standards and professional pride. Membership in a
Technical Association is not tied to employment status; one may be an
unemployed cook, a freelance data analyst or a caregiver between jobs.
What matters is not whether one currently holds a paid position but
whether one has completed training, demonstrated competence and
participated in the life of the Association.footnote^47 <#note-47>

Technical Associations define and transform professional standards. The
work of a teacher is not judged in the same way as that of an architect
or a surgeon; the goals of a software engineer differ from those of a
sanitation expert. In each field, Technical Associations set
professional standards of competence and excellence through processes of
democratic debate, as members contest and refine their visions of what
best practices should be and how their fields should evolve in response
to social and technological shifts. By embedding these debates within
stable institutions, Technical Associations also provide a crucial
mechanism for accountability. In a world where monetary incentives are
muted, professional excellence must be upheld through peer evaluation.
Professionalization is not just a credential; it is a continually
reaffirmed capacity to contribute to collective goals. Trust in a
profession—and pride in belonging to it—depend on the integrity with
which Technical Associations hold their members to the standards of
their craft.

Technical Associations also provide a key institutional bridge between
expertise and democracy, ensuring that experts participate in decision-
making structures as accountable representatives, rather than as an
unchallengeable elite. Hence the democratic process through which
Technical Associations elect their own representatives to participate in
Evaluation Committees and on Investment Boards and Coordinating
Committees. These elections are structured to reflect the diversity of
perspectives within a field, ensuring that expertise is represented not
as a monolithic voice but as a contested process, acknowledging that
experts disagree, even within a single technical domain, on
methodologies, priorities and the trade-offs between different values.
Instead of suppressing these conflicts, the democratic structure of
Technical Associations brings them into the open, allowing them to be
debated within a framework that is accountable to the broader society.
Since technical representatives can be recalled and replaced by their
Associations, their authority is contingent on maintaining the trust of
their peers. This guarantees that expertise remains dynamic, adapting to
new developments and evolving priorities, rather than ossifying into
bureaucratic stagnation.

Without safeguards, Technical Associations risk becoming insular or
resistant to change. To counter this, they need protocols that encourage
cross-training, allowing workers from other fields to bring in fresh
perspectives. Openness prevents them from becoming closed guilds,
stifling innovation and limiting access to new talent. A dedicated
Investment Board for Technical Associations addresses this challenge.
Like other Boards, this one allocates investment resources, which
Associations need to upgrade their own training facilities,
infrastructure and tools. At the same time, this Board certifies
Associations, ensuring they meet rigorous standards of professionalism,
ethical conduct and societal value. The Board could also mediate
disputes within and between rival Associations, and adjudicate
accusations of pseudoscience—in addition to helping emerging fields,
such as synthetic biology, figure out how to structure themselves.

Finally, the Board serves as the space where Associations negotiate
relative incomes across professions, aligning financial rewards with
societal priorities. In a multi-criterial economy, as we have seen,
firms do not directly pay workers’ salaries. Instead, they pay rental
charges for labour, just as they pay rental charges for fixed assets and
land. These rental charges are denominated in points and fluctuate based
on the scarcity or abundance of different types of labour. When demand
for workers from a particular profession rises, rental charges increase,
encouraging firms to economize on their use. When demand falls, rental
charges decrease, signalling labour availability. However, individual
salaries, paid in credits, do not fluctuate with rental charges.

Deciding how salaries compare across professions—whether nurses should
earn more than engineers, or care workers more than administrative
workers—is a social issue. Since credits correspond to a fixed share of
total production—although one that the Demos can expand or contract over
time—raising salaries in one area effectively reduces them in others.
Wage-setting thus becomes a structured process of balancing economic
needs with evolving social values. A general movement towards the
compression of salary spreads will tend to prevail. However, if a
profession sees rising rental charges but struggles to attract enough
workers, it may be desirable to raise salaries to encourage more
entrants. Conversely, if too many people enter a profession with limited
opportunities, salaries may be adjusted downward to discourage over-
saturation. But salary decisions are not dictated directly by changes in
labour-market conditions. A society that values teaching or care work,
for example, may choose to raise salaries for those professions even if
their rental charges remain relatively low. Labour-market signals remain
one consideration among many, always subordinated to collective
judgement about social priorities.

Decoupling salary determination from firm-level decision-making has
major consequences for economic coordination. In capitalism, wages vary
according to firm profitability, producing high-paying jobs in finance
and tech while essential jobs such as teaching and care work remain
underpaid. In the multi-criterial economy, salaries are set at the
societal level, preventing extreme inequalities from emerging within and
between sectors. Firms, meanwhile, do not compete for labour by offering
higher salaries. They simply decide whether to hire a given type of
worker based on the Association’s rental charge. This salary system also
reshapes worker loyalty. Under capitalism, workers depend on their
employers for income, making them vulnerable to exploitation and job
insecurity. Here, professional identity is anchored in Technical
Associations rather than firms. As long as workers uphold their
profession’s standards, they retain their salary levels even when
transitioning between jobs. If there is no work for them to do at a
particular firm, they can leave without fear of salary loss. If a firm
pressures workers toward self-exploitation—demanding excessive
productivity, cutting corners or disregarding professional ethics—
workers can turn to their Association for support. This ensures that
efficiency pressures do not degrade working conditions and that
professional standards remain the foundation of economic life.


      8. associational life

A truly multi-criterial system needs institutions that do more than
allocate resources. They must also shape knowledge, coordinate expertise
and provide space for cultural and political experimentation. Unlike
earlier eras, when innovation could emerge from isolated breakthroughs
inside individual firms, modern technological development requires a
massive and interlinked infrastructure of research, consultation and
coordination. At the same time, a multi-criterial economy demands more
of its technology than an efficiency-first economy ever did. It needs an
infrastructure capable of identifying and mitigating value trade-offs
across domains, rather than ignoring them in pursuit of narrow
efficiencies. If Technical Associations ensure that specialized
expertise is cultivated and integrated into economic decision-making,
they do not, on their own, constitute a complete innovation system. In a
multi-criterial society, technological progress is not confined to a
single efficiency-driven trajectory but instead serves diverse social
and cultural goals. Far from dampening technological dynamism, this
system accelerates and generalizes it.

Even if a multi-criterial society chose to limit total output for
ecological reasons, innovation would remain vigorous, pushing the
boundaries of what can be achieved within environmental constraints; new
energy sources, regenerative production methods and waste-free
industrial processes could allow it to expand what it produced without
exceeding planetary limits. The direction of technological change will
be shaped by the kinds of problems society chooses to solve and the
goals it chooses to pursue.footnote^48 <#note-48> As priorities shift,
so do investment funds for innovation. To sustain this development, the
multi-criterial economy will depend upon a broad ecosystem of
institutions—research institutes, consultancies, local organizations—
each playing a distinct role in guiding innovation. The history of
technological advance already shows what this kind of public innovation
system can achieve: the internet, life-saving vaccines and renewable
energy technologies all emerged from public investment and open
collaboration rather than market competition. By prioritizing societal
goals over financial returns, this system ensures that technological
progress benefits everyone, driving development along paths that would
otherwise have remained unexplored.

The necessity of associational life extends beyond the technical sphere.
A multi-criterial society is about enabling people to live richer, more
expansive lives. What we might call the associational layer opens up
into a world of cultural and political activities which people pursue
freely, on their own terms. Its self-run organizations constitute a
‘Free Sector’, populated with Free Associations.footnote^49 <#note-49>
This move to the associational layer means that, in the strictest sense,
this is no longer a model of an economy. It is the outline of a larger
social architecture: a system that integrates what we once called ‘the
economy’ into the broader terrain of political, social and cultural
life. The boundaries between the economy and politics, which in
capitalism were always contested but never fully dissolved, are here
deliberately dismantled. What was formerly the economy//is no longer an
isolated domain; it becomes a field of collective judgement and
political imagination, deeply intertwined with all other aspects of life.

Distinct from the functional economy—including from this perspective the
Technical Associations and the investment system—the Free Sector is a
structured space where people organize, experiment and engage in
intellectual, cultural and political life without being constrained by
economic justifications. Unlike markets, which require goods and
services to prove their worth through consumer demand, or Investment
Boards, which allocate resources based on assessed social priorities,
the Free Sector is governed by a different principle: the right of
individuals and groups to explore and develop ideas, movements and
institutions without needing to justify themselves in advance. This is
not a side feature of a multi-criterial society. It is an essential part
of how it remains dynamic, adaptive and open-ended. Historically,
discussions of a realm of freedom beyond economic necessity have often
centred on individual pursuits—education, leisure and cultural
enrichment. But in practice, what people do in their free time is just
as often associative as it is solitary.footnote^50 <#note-50>

The organization of the Free Sector guarantees that people not only have
the time but also the resources needed to question and reshape the
trajectory of society itself. Activities within the Sector are funded
through free points, which account for a dedicated share of total
production in each cycle. As we’ve touched on above, these are
distributed equally to all, on a monthly or annual basis. In contrast to
credits, which are used for personal consumption, free points can only
be donated to Free Associations. Individuals can create or support
associations across artistic, scientific, political and cultural domains
—gaming and techno clubs, science and sports federations, political
groupuscules and full-fledged political parties. These Free Associations
use their points to pay rental charges for facilities, equipment and
intermediate inputs—for everything they need to function—just like
firms. However, they are not allowed to hire labour. Work in the Free
Sector remains voluntary, ensuring that its activities are driven by
intrinsic motivation rather than commodified incentives. To participate,
associations need only to register with the Investment Board that
governs the Free Sector—which would also be responsible for monitoring
these associations to make sure they are not violating any rules. Once
registered, they can acquire free points through donations and apply for
fixed assets.

In capitalist societies, free time has been defined largely in negative
terms: time off from work, a temporary escape from economic demands.
People spend much of their leisure time recovering from exhaustion,
numbing themselves through passive entertainment—watching tv or
scrolling social-media posts—or catching up on domestic labour. The
pressures of overwork, financial precarity and social instability leave
little space for sustained engagement in creative, intellectual or
political life. A multi-criterial society changes this dynamic.
Universal security, shorter working hours and universal services
liberate people from survival anxiety, enabling them to think beyond
immediate necessity and explore their passions. As people adjust to
their newfound freedom, free time evolves from a site of recuperation
into an active domain of social life. This shift—from recovery to
engagement—redefines the meaning of freedom itself. Not merely freedom
from economic coercion, it is the freedom to pursue shared projects and
to co-create social life alongside others.footnote^51 <#note-51>

One of the defining features of Free Sector activity is that it operates
in a space where needs are often un- or under-defined. Robotics
enthusiasts might build machines that stretch the boundaries of
possibility simply because they enjoy the challenge. An independent
research team might explore speculative fields of knowledge that
established institutions dismiss. These endeavours are not constrained
by pre-existing social expectations or narrow arguments about utility;
they are driven by the intrinsic motivations of participants. Because of
the flexibility of free points, these associations can exist at multiple
scales. Some are small self-organized groups. Others grow into larger
institutions that serve as intermediaries, aggregators or hubs for
specialized work. Arts councils, for instance, can collect free points
from donors and redistribute them to experimental creators. Independent
research institutes play a parallel role in the intellectual realm.
Religious and spiritual organizations are also sustained through
voluntary support. Donors cannot dictate what the organizations do, but
they can withdraw their support if the Association no longer aligns with
their values. Under capitalism, many artistic and intellectual pursuits
depend on wealthy benefactors, government grants or corporate
sponsorship, each of which imposes constraints on what can be pursued.
The Free Sector replaces this with a decentralized form of patronage,
where power over cultural, intellectual and political life is
distributed across society.

The political significance of the Free Sector extends far beyond
cultural and intellectual life. It is also foundational to the
democratic system. Under capitalism, political organizing is heavily
constrained by financial barriers. Movements that challenge entrenched
power structures struggle to acquire resources, while corporate and
elite interests dominate public discourse through lobbying, media
control and campaign finance. In a multi-criterial society, political
organizations are supported directly through free points, ensuring that
movements are sustained by public participation rather than elite
patronage. This system enables a far more dynamic and contested
political landscape. New ideas can gain traction without requiring the
backing of established interests. Movements that might struggle under
capitalism can thrive in a world where people have the means to support
them directly. Political organizations can form, dissolve and
reconfigure as the priorities of the population shift. Democratic life
in the Free Sector ensures that society is always open to internal
contestation, collective learning and political renewal.

What has been outlined here is merely the institutional framework of a
multi-criterial economy freed from the logic of profit. The political
content that animates it would emerge from the choices and struggles of
its participants, who—secure in their access to the necessities of life—
would be free to decide collectively which among the possible
alternative futures they wish to pursue, and to transform their world
accordingly.

Saros proposes a dual-currency system in which consumers receive labour-
based credits to acquire goods, while firms bid for production inputs
using planning board-allocated points. He imagines economic coordination
as a once-per-cycle process: firms bid for all their inputs in a single,
simultaneous auction, assuming static knowledge of needs, capacities and
technologies. Unlike Saros’s model, the present proposal employs credits
and points within more traditional, decentralized market interactions,
which are structured specifically to eliminate financial accumulation
and thus enable genuine multi-criterial production.

tickets, which are presented upon entry and immediately withdrawn from
circulation. See Peter Hudis, /Marx’s Concept of the Alternative to

16 <#reference-16> Land in this system is publicly owned, and commercial
space is hired from the regional Land Authority. Labour, as we have
seen, is rented from the relevant Technical Associations. Rental prices
for land and labour fluctuate with supply and demand—but, crucially,
point-denominated rental prices for labour do not directly affect
credit-denominated salaries for work; the two are structurally separate.
The need for this separation is discussed most fully in Michael Albert
and Robin Hahnel, /The Political Economy of Participatory Economics/,
Princeton 1991. Rental charges for capital goods—machinery, buildings,
equipment, hardware, software—is set as a percentage of the purchasing
price, depreciated over time according to standard geometric methods.
Again, once points have been used for rental charges they are removed
from the system.
17 <#reference-17> I assume we are using this model to build a largely
post-growth economy—one in which the total quantity of goods and
services produced remains relatively stable over time. After an initial
period of transition, which would involve adjustments to the size and
shape of the economy, investment would largely be directed toward
qualitative improvements in production. However, the model is
structurally compatible with either growth or degrowth: what matters is
not the pace of expansion, but the priorities embedded in the allocation
of investment.

29 <#reference-29> Ecological constraints may require scaling back
resource-intensive production, but a society that consumes fewer
material goods can still live better if it invests in low-impact service
activities that enhance life across multiple dimensions. See Kristin
Ross, /Communal Luxury: The Political Imaginary of the Paris Commune/,
London and New York 2015; Friends of the Classless Society, ‘Contours of
the World Commune’, /Endnotes/, vol. 5, 2019.
30 <#reference-30> See Philippe Van Parijs and Yannick Vanderborght, /
Basic Income: A Radical Proposal for a Free Society and a Sane Economy/,
Cambridge ma 2017; Guy Standing, /Basic Income: And How We Can Make It
Happen/, London 2017; Erik Olin Wright, /How to Be an Anti-Capitalist in
the 21st Century/, London 2019. In /Automation and the Future of Work/,
Ch. 5, I criticized the idea that a basic income could serve as a silver
bullet for the problems of increasingly stagnant, late-capitalist
societies. But that critique does not diminish the role such policies
might play in an emancipated future, where basic income could support
autonomy and enable choice within a reimagined system of universal
provisioning.
31 <#reference-31> On the politics of needs, see Agnes Heller, /The
Theory of Need in Marx/, London 1976; Kate Soper, /On Human Needs/,
Brighton 1981; Len Doyal and Ian Gough, ‘A Theory of Human Needs’, /
Critical Social Policy/, vol. 4, no. 10, 1984; Nancy Fraser, ‘Social
Justice in the Age of Identity Politics’, in Nancy Fraser and Axel
Honneth, /Redistribution or Recognition? A Political-Philosophical
Exchange/, London and New York 2003, Ch. 1.
32 <#reference-32> Prices in points markets are not mechanically
determined by supply and demand but set by producers themselves—and
hence are ‘administered prices’ in the strict sense. In fact most prices
are set in advance by the dominant producers in today’s capitalist
economies: for groceries, consumer electronics, cars etc. In a multi-
criterial system, pricing power is redistributed: Investment Boards
govern capacity expansion, shaping the competitive landscape, while
allowing firms to set prices within known and stable parameters. On
administered prices, see Frederic Lee, /Post-Keynesian Price Theory/,
Cambridge 1998, as well as Lee’s /Microeconomic Theory: A Heterodox
Approach/, London 2018. For a mainstream treatment that reaches similar
conclusions, see Alan Blinder /et al/., /Asking about Prices: A New
Approach to Understanding Price Stickiness/, New York 1998.
33 <#reference-33> For classic analyses of the structural challenges
facing worker-managed firms, see Benjamin Ward, ‘The Firm in Illyria:
Market Syndicalism’, /American Economic Review/, vol. 48, no. 4, 1958;
Evsey Domar, ‘The Soviet Collective Farm as a Producer Cooperative’, /
American Economic Review/, vol. 56, no. 4, 1966; James Meade, ‘The
Theory of Labour-Managed Firms and of Profit Sharing’, /Economic
Journal/, vol. 82, no. 325, 1972; Jaroslav Vanek, /The Participatory
Economy/, Ithaca 1971; Gregory Dow, /Governing the Firm: Workers’
Control in Theory and Practice/, Cambridge 2003. For a useful
counterpoint to these critiques, see Jan Vanek, /The Economics of
Workers’ Management: A Yugoslav Case Study/, London 2017 [1969]. For a
recent attempt to build a coherent system around worker-managed firms,
see Mike Beggs, ‘The Market and Workplace in a Democratic Socialism’, /
Catalyst/, vol. 6, no. 3, 2022, which proposes externalized finance
through public banks and wage stability through national benchmarks to
overcome common property problems.

Laloux, /Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations
Inspired by the Next Stage in Human Consciousness/, Brussels 2014. See

35 <#reference-35> Here I draw on the Self-Determination Theory
developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan in /Self-Determination Theory:
Basic Psychological Needs in Motivation, Development and Wellness/, New
York 2017; see also Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi, /Beyond Boredom and

36 <#reference-36> For an example, see Åke Sandberg, ed., /Enriching
Production: Perspectives on Volvo’s Uddevalla Plant as an Alternative to
Lean Production/, Aldershot 1995.
37 <#reference-37> The problem of how to allocate unpleasant or less
desirable work has been central to debates over democratic planning. See
Albert and Hahnel, /The Political Economy of Participatory Economics/;
and Devine, /Democracy and Economic Planning/ for contrasting perspectives.
38 <#reference-38> The International Standard Industrial Classification
of All Economic Activities (isic, Rev.4) provides a first approximation
of how these sectors might be divided up.
39 <#reference-39> This structure draws inspiration from Devine, /
Democracy and Economic Planning/, though Devine’s model involves a more
layered institutional architecture, with interacting community and
sectoral boards operating on multiple levels.
40 <#reference-40> Direct or participatory democracy would be a fourth
model for the Investment Boards, but large-scale participatory processes
often struggle to manage complexity, sustain participation and prevent
inequalities of voice. For different perspectives, see Carole Pateman, /
Participation and Democratic Theory/, Cambridge 1970; Iris Marion
Young, /Inclusion and Democracy/, Oxford 2000; Archon Fung, ‘Varieties
of Participation in Complex Governance’, /Public Administration Review/,
vol. 66, 2006; Nadia Urbinati, /Representative Democracy: Principles and
Genealogy/, Chicago 2006; Ernesto Ganuza and Gianpaolo Baiocchi, /
Popular Democracy: The Paradox of Participation/, Stanford 2016.
41 <#reference-41> For debates about how to integrate technical
expertise into democratic decision-making, see Sheila Jasanoff, /The
Fifth Branch: Science Advisers as Policymakers/, Cambridge ma 1990;
Frank Fischer, /Democracy and Expertise: Reorienting Policy Inquiry/,
Oxford 2009; Hélène Landemore, /Open Democracy: Reinventing Popular Rule
for the Twenty-First Century/, Princeton 2020; Zeynep Pamuk, /Politics
and Expertise: How to Use Science in a Democratic Society/, Princeton 2024.
42 <#reference-42> While sortition has been proposed as a way to deepen
democratic participation, it should not be applied to investment
decisions, which concern political choices among alternative futures and
must remain contestable. For proposals for a society and economy
structured around sortition, see Alexander Guerrero, /Lottocracy:
Democracy without Elections/, Oxford 2024, and Michael McCarthy, /The
Master’s Tools: How Finance Wrecked Democracy (And a Radical Plan to
Rebuild It)/, London and New York 2025. For critical perspectives, see
Cristina Lafont, /Democracy without Shortcuts: A Participatory
Conception of Deliberative Democracy/, Oxford 2020; and Cristina Lafont
and Nadia Urbinati, /The Lottocratic Mentality: Defending Democracy
against Lottocracy/, Oxford 2025.
43 <#reference-43> For the comparison with competition in the sciences,
see John O’Neill, /The Market: Ethics, Knowledge and Politics/, Abingdon
1998.
44 <#reference-44> My approach to Investment Board governance is deeply
influenced by Pat Devine’s /Democracy and Economic Planning/. However,
Devine’s ‘negotiated coordination’ model seeks to promote consensus as
the normal basis of economic coordination. In his account, when
compromise cannot be reached, economic coordination breaks down; sectors
or activities grind to a halt until agreement is restored. By contrast,
the model proposed here—what we might call a /conflictual coordination
model/—assumes that disagreement is a permanent feature of economic
life. Coordination proceeds not by resolving conflict in advance but by
structuring it into political procedures capable of producing actionable
outcomes despite ongoing contestation.
45 <#reference-45> For a democratic vision of industrial policy, see Amy
Kapczynski and Joel Michaels, ‘Administering a Democratic Industrial
Policy’, /Harvard Law and Policy Review/, vol. 18, no. 2, 2023. On the
contemporary revival of industrial policy—particularly in relation to
both China’s rise and the need for a more coordinated form of the green
transition, not just dependent on carbon pricing—see Jesus Felipe,
ed., /Development and Modern Industrial Policy in Practice: Issues and
Country Experiences/, Cheltenham 2015; Ha-Joon Chang and Antonio
Andreoni, ‘Industrial Policy in the 21st Century’, /Development and
Change/, vol. 51, no. 2, 2020; Barry Naughton, /The Rise of China’s
Industrial Policy, 1978 to 2020/, Mexico City 2021; Réka Juhász, Nathan
Lane and Dani Rodrik, ‘The New Economics of Industrial Policy’, /Annual
Review of Economics/, vol. 16, no. 1, 2024; and Mariana Mazzucato and
Dani Rodrik, ‘Industrial Policy with Conditionalities: A Taxonomy and
Sample Cases’, Working paper, ucl Institute for Innovation and Public
Purpose, 2023.
46 <#reference-46> János Kornai famously criticized the ‘soft budget
constraint’ as a source of inefficiency under socialism, but his
analysis, like that of Włodzimierz Brus and Kazimierz Laski, mistakenly
identified the core problem as the absence of market-determined
(‘parametric’) prices and the continued use of sectoral industrial
policy. Yet it was precisely aggressive industrial policy that drove the
ussr’s extraordinary rates of industrial growth between the 1930s and
1950s—and allowed it to repel the Nazi invasion. See János Kornai, ‘The
Soft Budget Constraint’, /Kyklos/, vol. 39, no. 1, February 1986;
Włodzimierz Brus and Kazimierz Łaski, /From Marx to the Market:
Socialism in Search of an Economic System/, Oxford 1989.
47 <#reference-47> For an early version of this idea, see Émile
Durkheim, /The Division of Labour in Society/, trans. W. D. Halls,
Basingstoke 1984 [1893]), Preface to the Second Edition. Durkheim argued
that occupational groups could serve as vital intermediaries between
individuals and the wider economy, fostering solidarity, regulating
professional standards and ensuring a more ethical organization of
economic life.
48 <#reference-48> See Nils Rochowicz, ‘Planning Progress: Incorporating
Innovation and Structural Change into Models of Economic Planning’, /
Competition and Change/, vol. 29, no. 1, 2024.
49 <#reference-49> Some currents of socialist thinking have long
stressed the centrality of associational life. See Peter Kropotkin, /The
Conquest of Bread/ (1892); G. D. H. Cole, /Guild Socialism Restated/
(1920); R. H. Tawney, /The Acquisitive Society/ (1920); Anton
Pannekoek, /Workers’ Councils/ (1947). See also John O’Neill,
‘Socialism, Associations and the Market’, /Economy and Society/, vol.
32, no. 2, 2003; and, for an emphasis on associations in economic
democracy, Paul Hirst, /Associative Democracy: New Forms of Economic and
Social Governance/, Cambridge 1994.
50 <#reference-50> The distinction between a realm of necessity and a
realm of freedom has deep roots in Western thought, dating back to
Aristotle’s /Politics/, where the realm of freedom was reserved for a
leisured elite sustained by the labour of others. A major transformation
occurred with Thomas More’s /Utopia/ (1516), where the division was no
longer between classes but within each individual’s day, balancing
necessary labour and leisure for all—drawing on more positive late-
medieval conceptions of the dignity of work. This tradition was further
developed by early communists like Étienne Cabet and culminated in
Marx’s famous discussion of free time in the /Grundrisse/ and /Capital,
Vol. / iii, where he spoke of a ‘realm of freedom’ as arising only
beyond ‘the realm of necessity’. Marx’s focus on individualized free
time may owe something to Schiller’s /On the Aesthetic Education of Man/
(1795), which emphasized the cultivation of free creative capacities.
Karl Kautsky likewise linked the expansion of free time to the future of
the working class in /The Class Struggle/ (1892). This theme was taken
up by many 20th-century thinkers, stretching from W. E. B. DuBois to
André Gorz.
51 <#reference-51> Few discussions of the realm of free time have fully
engaged with its associative, collective dimension. An early emphasis on
voluntary association appears in Kropotkin’s /The Conquest of Bread/.
Bertrand Russell, in his excellent and understudied /Proposed Roads to
Freedom/ (1918), criticized Kropotkin’s proposal and developed his own
theories of art and culture under socialism. Later critiques of leisure
under capitalism, such as Guy Debord’s /The Society of the Spectacle/
(1967) and other Situationist writings, gestured towards associative
conceptions of freedom and cultural production. However, none of these
approaches directly addressed the question of how resources might be
collectively allocated within the realm of freely associated activity,
which is the central concern here.
